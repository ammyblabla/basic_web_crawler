for most of us, mobile phones are at the center of our universe. the typical feature set of these palm-size marvels is astounding. it's your phone, your messaging device, your web browser, your camera, your music player, your gps, and more. we're a smartphone-dominated nation, with 4g lte networks beating many home internet connections in terms of speed (not to mention 5g on the very near horizon). we have more good wireless carrier options than we've had in years, thanks to vigorous competition between the four major carriers and smaller virtual carriers like google fi. but some of our choices have constricted a bit: the smartphone os marketplace is basically down to apple's ios and google's android, and it's hard to find a really good simple voice phone nowadays. here at pcmag, we review almost every smartphone released on at&t, sprint, t-mobile, verizon wireless, and many of their sub-brands such as boost, cricket, and metropcs. rather than purely choosing the phones with the highest ratings here, we're trying to deliver a list of phones that's spread broadly across different price points. that means including two of last year's phones, the lg g6 and the iphone 8 plus, as lower-cost alternatives to this year's models. we think that provides a broader spectrum of buying options. but what should you be looking for when buying a cell phone? here are some key points to consider: which cell phone carrier should you choose? despite all the recent hardware and mobile software innovation, your wireless service provider remains your most important decision. no matter what device you buy, it's a doorstop unless you have solid wireless coverage. maybe you have friends and family on the same carrier that you talk to for free, and you don't want that to change with your next phone. maybe you're lusting after a certain device\u2014say, an unlocked smartphone for international travel. and of course, you want to choose a carrier that offers fair prices, and provides the best coverage in your area. these are all good reasons to put the carrier decision first. we have two major features to help you choose a carrier. for our readers' choice awards, pcmag readers tell us which carriers they prefer based on coverage, call quality, device selection, and other factors. and for our fastest mobile networks feature, we send drivers to 30 us cities to scope out which smartphone carriers have the best data coverage. because each of the national carriers sells a wide variety of phones, choosing your service provider should be your first move. here's a quick rundown of what each one offers: at&t's strongest areas of the country are the midwest, southeast, texas, and, this year, northern california. after a few struggling years, its speeds really jumped up in our most recent tests, and they'll get even better as the company turns on more \"5g evolution\" markets throughout the year. (5g evolution isn't 5g, but it's faster 4g than at&t previously had.) at&t owns directv, so it has some pricing bundles if you're also interested in satellite tv services.  sprint has had a rocky few years. its lte network is improving quickly, but it's still the worst-rated carrier by our readers because of several years of network troubles. that said, if you're willing to bet on a rising star, sprint has promotional service plans that can often be insanely cheap, especially if you're switching from another carrier.  see how we test cell phones t-mobile's fortunes have changed radically in the past few years thanks to maverick ceo john legere and his uncarrier plan. it's now the best rated of the \"big four\" carriers by our readers in the readers' choice awards. in our fastest mobile networks tests, it was basically neck-and-neck with verizon on speed and reliability. new low-band spectrum has radically expanded the carrier's lte network, so it can finally balance terrific speeds in cities with decent coverage in suburban areas. t-mobile also has the best international roaming plan, including to canada and mexico. verizon wireless is famed for its top-notch network quality and good customer service. its prices can be higher than the competition, but its combination of very reliable coverage and good speeds made verizon our fastest mobile networks winner this year. verizon also has the largest 4g lte network in the us. us cellular is only available in about half the country. it has a reputation for good customer service, but has been suffering recently in our surveys as readers have said its prices and lte network quality don't match up to some of the alternatives. there is also a wild slew of virtual operators that use the big four networks, but offer lower monthly rates, cheaper international calls, or other benefits. they're usually better for lighter users and most don't have family plans. the winners of our reader's choice awards this year were both virtual carriers: consumer cellular, which runs on at&t's network, and google fi, which combines sprint, t-mobile and us cellular. at&t owns cricket; sprint owns boost and virgin; t-mobile owns metropcs; and google owns google fi. tracfone is another prominent virtual carrier, with spinoff brands like straight talk, family mobile, and net10, all of which have their own plans. we spotlight some of our favorites in the best cheap cell phone plans you've never heard of. locked or unlocked? as carriers have moved to increasingly more confusing service and pricing plans, the value of unlocked phones has been rising accordingly. unlocked phones are bought from a third-party store or directly from the manufacturer, and aren't tied to any specific carrier. usually, you can use them with at&t or t-mobile. but some popular unlocked phones work on all four major carriers. if you want the best flexibility, look for a recent samsung, apple, or google pixel flagship, or a motorola phone. if you buy an unlocked phone, you'll be able to move it freely between compatible carriers. but even if you don't intend to ever change your carrier, unlocked phones are free of carrier bloatware and (with android phones) often receive software and os updates more quickly than the carrier versions do. what is the best smartphone? as more people become accustomed to instant email, web, music, and messaging access at all times of the day, regardless of where they are, smartphones have become almost indispensable. that said, there's plenty of variety out there\u2014not to mention devotees of specific os platforms. that makes sense, though; sometimes, a platform's user interface or app selection just speaks to you, and that's all there is to it. with that in mind, and at the risk of attracting flames, let's break it down as well as we can for those who aren't so fully vested.  there's actually less diversity in smartphone platforms and designs than there was a few years ago. right now, android and ios are the two top smartphone platforms, both in us sales and in the availability of third-party apps. the iphone has the best app store and the best media features. but apple's tightly controlled ecosystem can feel stifling to some, and ios isn't easy to customize or modify. there's far more variety among android handsets, and its open-source nature makes it a tweaker's dream. but it also means fragmented third-party app compatibility, occasional bugs, carrier-installed bloatware you can't remove, and scattered, often sporadic os updates. in terms of form factor, it's difficult to find a smartphone that isn't a solid black slab anymore. the only remaining, high-quality phone with a physical keyboard is the blackberry key2. it's a good device, and worth choosing if the physical keyboard is important to you, but fewer and fewer people seem to consider that a key feature with time. phones are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, to fit various sizes of hands. samsung's galaxy s9, lg's g7, and the google pixel 3 are taller and narrower than most other phones, giving them big screens that are easy to hold in one hand. the best phablets the word phablet, a portmanteau of phone and tablet, has largely gone out of style as pretty much all new phones are big phones. nowadays, it refers to the absolute biggest phones, generally with screens that are six inches diagonally or larger. these are devices that take either very large hands, or two hands, to hold. they're also devices that tend to be easy on tired or older eyes. the size of a phablet's screen doesn't necessarily reflect the size of the device. the 6.4-inch samsung galaxy note 9 is much narrower than the 6-inch zte blade z max, because it has smaller bezels and a taller, narrower screen. motorola and lg low-cost phablets tend to be good choices for people who want phones with easier-to-read, larger-to-type-on screens. the galaxy note 9 and the iphone xs max, meanwhile, are for people looking for the absolute ultimate power in their phones. the best feature phones a good portion of the us population is still using simpler phones, but there are surprisingly few current choices out there. there are still reasons to get a simple, less-expensive device: they're easier to use, and they charge much lower monthly fees because data isn't involved. there are some killer deals for voice-only usage on virtual carriers like tracfone and consumer cellular. we have one voice phone on this list, the kyocera cadence lte for verizon. the nokia 3310 3g is also unlocked, inexpensive, and works well with at&t-based carriers.  unlike smartphones, feature phones are a matter of \"what you see is what you get.\" they don't receive software upgrades or run thousands of additional apps (some feature phones come with app stores, but don't be fooled, they exist primarily to sell you additional-cost services, ringtones, wallpapers, and basic games). for voice quality, read our individual phone reviews. wireless network coverage is always the biggest factor, but individual phones can vary in reception, earpiece quality, transmission quality through the microphone, and side-tone (the echo of your own voice that helps prevent you from yelling at the other person). a phone with middling to poor reception quality can be almost impossible to use in a marginal coverage area, while one with excellent reception can make the best of the little signal that's available. another point to consider: some phones have much louder speakerphones than others. for more, see our picks for the best simple phones. we also have a roundup of the best phones for kids. the best budget phones this story tends to be headlined by very expensive phones, but you can get a perfectly good smartphone for between $100 and $250 upfront. we're big fans of motorola's low-end and midrange phones. they're unlocked and compatible with all us carriers, and they use a fast, clean version of the android os. the moto e series is available from carriers for under $100, and the moto g6 play is on amazon for $189; they're great deals. because of the current trade war between the us and china, the low-cost market has been hollowed out a bit recently. we used to recommend several phones from honor, huawei, and zte, but their future in the us is still in doubt. for the moment, look primarily at lower-end motorola and lg phones if you're trying to save money. the least expensive iphone we currently recommend is the $449 iphone 7. apple tends to program its operating systems so that once a model is about three years old, it can no longer handle some of the latest features. that means iphone models older than the 7 are getting to the end of their fully supported lives. don't buy an older iphone model.  cell phone plan pricing cell phone pricing is more confusing than ever. some carriers still have the old-school, binding two-year contracts where you pay a higher monthly rate in exchange for a discounted phone. but there also now payment plans where you pay the full retail cost of your phone, but pay less on your service plan; fast-upgrade and leasing plans where you pay a monthly fee and trade in your phone for a new one every year; as well as more carriers just selling phones for their retail price upfront. which one you choose depends on how long you intend to keep your phone and what you want to do with it after you're done with it. if you intend to upgrade frequently, you'll get the most financial advantage by buying phones upfront and reselling them on ebay when you're done with them, but that takes effort. traditional two-year deals make sense if you stick with the plan of getting a new phone every two years and you're ok with the long-term commitment. t-mobile and verizon don't offer two-year contracts anymore; you either pay upfront, or pay in installments over 24 months. apple offers leasing and installment plans just like the carriers do. there are also your monthly carrier fees. and this is where things gets tricky, as the carriers make it exceedingly difficult to figure out how much you'll actually pay per month. t-mobile now includes fees in its base advertised plan prices, and we hope other carriers will follow. at&t and verizon plans tend to cost the most, but those two carriers have the best voice and data coverage in the nation. sprint and t-mobile offer considerable savings, especially on unlimited voice, data, and texting plans. to see our most recent reviews, check out our cell phones product guide.

why you need a faster phone       in our last fastest mobile networks survey of the 4g era, verizon once again cements its position as the 4g leader. the nation's largest carrier also runs the nation's fastest lte data network, with the fastest download speeds and lowest latency. we've been drive testing american mobile networks since 2010, first 3g and then 4g, watching speeds grow and coverage expand. yes, there are still dead zones out there\u2014american cities have less reliable mobile coverage than canadian cities, we've found. but we've seen steady improvement over the years, especially from t-mobile, and americans in major metropolitan areas can now generally assume a level of service they couldn't a few years ago. faster speeds than ever compared with 2017, we're seeing faster, more consistent lte connections on all four major us wireless networks. peak speeds have jumped from the 200mbps range to the 300mbps range, average download speeds have bumped up by 10mbps or more, and latency has dropped by 10ms. that's an impressive change in one year, and it continues the trend of improvement that we've seen over the past several years of testing. see how speeds have changed over the past few years on our national results page.  much more than previous years, we saw many cities where the carrier with the fastest average download speeds didn't win the award. we're ok with that. our speed score tries to balance all of the components of a mobile connection: downloads, uploads, availability, and latency. (for more details, see our testing methodology page.) as we get to a world where we can assume 20mbps or higher download speeds on 4g in most cities, other questions arise: where are those speeds most consistent? where is the network most responsive, especially when you're downloading pages made of many small files? our tests cover data speeds and reliability; we don't make voice calls. but our awards for data service apply more and more to voice, too. all of the carriers other than sprint now use voice-over-lte, piping their voice calls through their data networks. so the reliability of those lte data networks translates into the reliability of your hd voice calls, as well.  get ready for 5g next year, we're going to have a new challenge: 5g is coming. while all of the carriers have built somewhat similar 4g networks (well, except for sprint's extreme focus on downloads over uploads), they're taking radically different approaches for 5g. at&t and verizon are going for much higher speeds over smaller areas; t-mobile is looking to blanket the nation, but at slower speeds. while they're all going to call their new networks 5g, it'll be like they're coming from different worlds. for more, see 4g and 5g: what's next? what does this mean for choosing your wireless carrier? we've seen broad, multi-year trends developing recently. verizon and t-mobile are the clear network leaders for smartphone users, with t-mobile's strength coming in uploads, for the social-media, content-creator crowd. at&t and sprint have focused on download speeds, so they are best for content consumption, video streaming, and web browsing. if you're dissatisfied with your speeds and coverage, consider switching your phone before you switch your carrier. all four major carriers have been laying down new technologies recently that old phones just don't support. our story on why you need a new phone explains this further. national results make great headlines, but we think our city-by-city results will be more relevant to you. verizon won or tied in 20 cities/areas, but other carriers\u2014especially t-mobile\u2014won plenty of awards as well. we stopped by more than a dozen locations in each of 30 us cities, as well as collecting data on the drives between them, to build our city results. click through this story, or use the navigation above, to see the results in

for most of us, mobile phones are at the center of our universe. the typical feature set of these palm-size marvels is astounding. it's your phone, your messaging device, your web browser, your camera, your music player, your gps, and more. we're a smartphone-dominated nation, with 4g lte networks beating many home internet connections in terms of speed (not to mention 5g on the very near horizon). we have more good wireless carrier options than we've had in years, thanks to vigorous competition between the four major carriers and smaller virtual carriers like google fi. but some of our choices have constricted a bit: the smartphone os marketplace is basically down to apple's ios and google's android, and it's hard to find a really good simple voice phone nowadays. here at pcmag, we review almost every smartphone released on at&t, sprint, t-mobile, verizon wireless, and many of their sub-brands such as boost, cricket, and metropcs. rather than purely choosing the phones with the highest ratings here, we're trying to deliver a list of phones that's spread broadly across different price points. that means including two of last year's phones, the lg g6 and the iphone 8 plus, as lower-cost alternatives to this year's models. we think that provides a broader spectrum of buying options. but what should you be looking for when buying a cell phone? here are some key points to consider: which cell phone carrier should you choose? despite all the recent hardware and mobile software innovation, your wireless service provider remains your most important decision. no matter what device you buy, it's a doorstop unless you have solid wireless coverage. maybe you have friends and family on the same carrier that you talk to for free, and you don't want that to change with your next phone. maybe you're lusting after a certain device\u2014say, an unlocked smartphone for international travel. and of course, you want to choose a carrier that offers fair prices, and provides the best coverage in your area. these are all good reasons to put the carrier decision first. we have two major features to help you choose a carrier. for our readers' choice awards, pcmag readers tell us which carriers they prefer based on coverage, call quality, device selection, and other factors. and for our fastest mobile networks feature, we send drivers to 30 us cities to scope out which smartphone carriers have the best data coverage. because each of the national carriers sells a wide variety of phones, choosing your service provider should be your first move. here's a quick rundown of what each one offers: at&t's strongest areas of the country are the midwest, southeast, texas, and, this year, northern california. after a few struggling years, its speeds really jumped up in our most recent tests, and they'll get even better as the company turns on more \"5g evolution\" markets throughout the year. (5g evolution isn't 5g, but it's faster 4g than at&t previously had.) at&t owns directv, so it has some pricing bundles if you're also interested in satellite tv services.  sprint has had a rocky few years. its lte network is improving quickly, but it's still the worst-rated carrier by our readers because of several years of network troubles. that said, if you're willing to bet on a rising star, sprint has promotional service plans that can often be insanely cheap, especially if you're switching from another carrier.  see how we test cell phones t-mobile's fortunes have changed radically in the past few years thanks to maverick ceo john legere and his uncarrier plan. it's now the best rated of the \"big four\" carriers by our readers in the readers' choice awards. in our fastest mobile networks tests, it was basically neck-and-neck with verizon on speed and reliability. new low-band spectrum has radically expanded the carrier's lte network, so it can finally balance terrific speeds in cities with decent coverage in suburban areas. t-mobile also has the best international roaming plan, including to canada and mexico. verizon wireless is famed for its top-notch network quality and good customer service. its prices can be higher than the competition, but its combination of very reliable coverage and good speeds made verizon our fastest mobile networks winner this year. verizon also has the largest 4g lte network in the us. us cellular is only available in about half the country. it has a reputation for good customer service, but has been suffering recently in our surveys as readers have said its prices and lte network quality don't match up to some of the alternatives. there is also a wild slew of virtual operators that use the big four networks, but offer lower monthly rates, cheaper international calls, or other benefits. they're usually better for lighter users and most don't have family plans. the winners of our reader's choice awards this year were both virtual carriers: consumer cellular, which runs on at&t's network, and google fi, which combines sprint, t-mobile and us cellular. at&t owns cricket; sprint owns boost and virgin; t-mobile owns metropcs; and google owns google fi. tracfone is another prominent virtual carrier, with spinoff brands like straight talk, family mobile, and net10, all of which have their own plans. we spotlight some of our favorites in the best cheap cell phone plans you've never heard of. locked or unlocked? as carriers have moved to increasingly more confusing service and pricing plans, the value of unlocked phones has been rising accordingly. unlocked phones are bought from a third-party store or directly from the manufacturer, and aren't tied to any specific carrier. usually, you can use them with at&t or t-mobile. but some popular unlocked phones work on all four major carriers. if you want the best flexibility, look for a recent samsung, apple, or google pixel flagship, or a motorola phone. if you buy an unlocked phone, you'll be able to move it freely between compatible carriers. but even if you don't intend to ever change your carrier, unlocked phones are free of carrier bloatware and (with android phones) often receive software and os updates more quickly than the carrier versions do. what is the best smartphone? as more people become accustomed to instant email, web, music, and messaging access at all times of the day, regardless of where they are, smartphones have become almost indispensable. that said, there's plenty of variety out there\u2014not to mention devotees of specific os platforms. that makes sense, though; sometimes, a platform's user interface or app selection just speaks to you, and that's all there is to it. with that in mind, and at the risk of attracting flames, let's break it down as well as we can for those who aren't so fully vested.  there's actually less diversity in smartphone platforms and designs than there was a few years ago. right now, android and ios are the two top smartphone platforms, both in us sales and in the availability of third-party apps. the iphone has the best app store and the best media features. but apple's tightly controlled ecosystem can feel stifling to some, and ios isn't easy to customize or modify. there's far more variety among android handsets, and its open-source nature makes it a tweaker's dream. but it also means fragmented third-party app compatibility, occasional bugs, carrier-installed bloatware you can't remove, and scattered, often sporadic os updates. in terms of form factor, it's difficult to find a smartphone that isn't a solid black slab anymore. the only remaining, high-quality phone with a physical keyboard is the blackberry key2. it's a good device, and worth choosing if the physical keyboard is important to you, but fewer and fewer people seem to consider that a key feature with time. phones are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, to fit various sizes of hands. samsung's galaxy s9, lg's g7, and the google pixel 3 are taller and narrower than most other phones, giving them big screens that are easy to hold in one hand. the best phablets the word phablet, a portmanteau of phone and tablet, has largely gone out of style as pretty much all new phones are big phones. nowadays, it refers to the absolute biggest phones, generally with screens that are six inches diagonally or larger. these are devices that take either very large hands, or two hands, to hold. they're also devices that tend to be easy on tired or older eyes. the size of a phablet's screen doesn't necessarily reflect the size of the device. the 6.4-inch samsung galaxy note 9 is much narrower than the 6-inch zte blade z max, because it has smaller bezels and a taller, narrower screen. motorola and lg low-cost phablets tend to be good choices for people who want phones with easier-to-read, larger-to-type-on screens. the galaxy note 9 and the iphone xs max, meanwhile, are for people looking for the absolute ultimate power in their phones. the best feature phones a good portion of the us population is still using simpler phones, but there are surprisingly few current choices out there. there are still reasons to get a simple, less-expensive device: they're easier to use, and they charge much lower monthly fees because data isn't involved. there are some killer deals for voice-only usage on virtual carriers like tracfone and consumer cellular. we have one voice phone on this list, the kyocera cadence lte for verizon. the nokia 3310 3g is also unlocked, inexpensive, and works well with at&t-based carriers.  unlike smartphones, feature phones are a matter of \"what you see is what you get.\" they don't receive software upgrades or run thousands of additional apps (some feature phones come with app stores, but don't be fooled, they exist primarily to sell you additional-cost services, ringtones, wallpapers, and basic games). for voice quality, read our individual phone reviews. wireless network coverage is always the biggest factor, but individual phones can vary in reception, earpiece quality, transmission quality through the microphone, and side-tone (the echo of your own voice that helps prevent you from yelling at the other person). a phone with middling to poor reception quality can be almost impossible to use in a marginal coverage area, while one with excellent reception can make the best of the little signal that's available. another point to consider: some phones have much louder speakerphones than others. for more, see our picks for the best simple phones. we also have a roundup of the best phones for kids. the best budget phones this story tends to be headlined by very expensive phones, but you can get a perfectly good smartphone for between $100 and $250 upfront. we're big fans of motorola's low-end and midrange phones. they're unlocked and compatible with all us carriers, and they use a fast, clean version of the android os. the moto e series is available from carriers for under $100, and the moto g6 play is on amazon for $189; they're great deals. because of the current trade war between the us and china, the low-cost market has been hollowed out a bit recently. we used to recommend several phones from honor, huawei, and zte, but their future in the us is still in doubt. for the moment, look primarily at lower-end motorola and lg phones if you're trying to save money. the least expensive iphone we currently recommend is the $449 iphone 7. apple tends to program its operating systems so that once a model is about three years old, it can no longer handle some of the latest features. that means iphone models older than the 7 are getting to the end of their fully supported lives. don't buy an older iphone model.  cell phone plan pricing cell phone pricing is more confusing than ever. some carriers still have the old-school, binding two-year contracts where you pay a higher monthly rate in exchange for a discounted phone. but there also now payment plans where you pay the full retail cost of your phone, but pay less on your service plan; fast-upgrade and leasing plans where you pay a monthly fee and trade in your phone for a new one every year; as well as more carriers just selling phones for their retail price upfront. which one you choose depends on how long you intend to keep your phone and what you want to do with it after you're done with it. if you intend to upgrade frequently, you'll get the most financial advantage by buying phones upfront and reselling them on ebay when you're done with them, but that takes effort. traditional two-year deals make sense if you stick with the plan of getting a new phone every two years and you're ok with the long-term commitment. t-mobile and verizon don't offer two-year contracts anymore; you either pay upfront, or pay in installments over 24 months. apple offers leasing and installment plans just like the carriers do. there are also your monthly carrier fees. and this is where things gets tricky, as the carriers make it exceedingly difficult to figure out how much you'll actually pay per month. t-mobile now includes fees in its base advertised plan prices, and we hope other carriers will follow. at&t and verizon plans tend to cost the most, but those two carriers have the best voice and data coverage in the nation. sprint and t-mobile offer considerable savings, especially on unlimited voice, data, and texting plans. to see our most recent reviews, check out our cell phones product guide.

why you need a faster phone       in our last fastest mobile networks survey of the 4g era, verizon once again cements its position as the 4g leader. the nation's largest carrier also runs the nation's fastest lte data network, with the fastest download speeds and lowest latency. we've been drive testing american mobile networks since 2010, first 3g and then 4g, watching speeds grow and coverage expand. yes, there are still dead zones out there\u2014american cities have less reliable mobile coverage than canadian cities, we've found. but we've seen steady improvement over the years, especially from t-mobile, and americans in major metropolitan areas can now generally assume a level of service they couldn't a few years ago. faster speeds than ever compared with 2017, we're seeing faster, more consistent lte connections on all four major us wireless networks. peak speeds have jumped from the 200mbps range to the 300mbps range, average download speeds have bumped up by 10mbps or more, and latency has dropped by 10ms. that's an impressive change in one year, and it continues the trend of improvement that we've seen over the past several years of testing. see how speeds have changed over the past few years on our national results page.  much more than previous years, we saw many cities where the carrier with the fastest average download speeds didn't win the award. we're ok with that. our speed score tries to balance all of the components of a mobile connection: downloads, uploads, availability, and latency. (for more details, see our testing methodology page.) as we get to a world where we can assume 20mbps or higher download speeds on 4g in most cities, other questions arise: where are those speeds most consistent? where is the network most responsive, especially when you're downloading pages made of many small files? our tests cover data speeds and reliability; we don't make voice calls. but our awards for data service apply more and more to voice, too. all of the carriers other than sprint now use voice-over-lte, piping their voice calls through their data networks. so the reliability of those lte data networks translates into the reliability of your hd voice calls, as well.  get ready for 5g next year, we're going to have a new challenge: 5g is coming. while all of the carriers have built somewhat similar 4g networks (well, except for sprint's extreme focus on downloads over uploads), they're taking radically different approaches for 5g. at&t and verizon are going for much higher speeds over smaller areas; t-mobile is looking to blanket the nation, but at slower speeds. while they're all going to call their new networks 5g, it'll be like they're coming from different worlds. for more, see 4g and 5g: what's next? what does this mean for choosing your wireless carrier? we've seen broad, multi-year trends developing recently. verizon and t-mobile are the clear network leaders for smartphone users, with t-mobile's strength coming in uploads, for the social-media, content-creator crowd. at&t and sprint have focused on download speeds, so they are best for content consumption, video streaming, and web browsing. if you're dissatisfied with your speeds and coverage, consider switching your phone before you switch your carrier. all four major carriers have been laying down new technologies recently that old phones just don't support. our story on why you need a new phone explains this further. national results make great headlines, but we think our city-by-city results will be more relevant to you. verizon won or tied in 20 cities/areas, but other carriers\u2014especially t-mobile\u2014won plenty of awards as well. we stopped by more than a dozen locations in each of 30 us cities, as well as collecting data on the drives between them, to build our city results. click through this story, or use the navigation above, to see the results in

kids  trust us, your kid wants a phone. but which one is best? check out our recommendations.         by   sascha segan     may 14, 2018 9:56am est  may 14, 2018        pcmag reviews products independently, but we may earn affiliate commissions from buying links on this page. terms of use.       when to get your kid a phone school's almost out, and your child is undoubtedly begging for a phone to get them through the summer. all the other kids have them, right? so why not yours? i'm one of pcmag's phone experts, and also a parent, so i've thought a lot about this. mobile phones are useful, powerful, and helpful. they're also expensive, distracting, and a potential gateway to a lot of nasty things on the internet. so should you get your kid a phone? and if so, which one? if you simply want to get straight to the recommended phones, scroll down to the bottom of the page. the cardinal rule there's one reason to give your child a phone: if they're often out of sight of trustworthy adults and may need to contact you or another caregiver. if your kid wants to play games or watch videos on a personal device, but doesn't actually need cellular connectivity, we recommend the ipod touch. at under $200, the ipod touch is essentially a phone-without-a-phone\u2014it lets your kid do everything they want with a phone, without the monthly costs associated with cellular service. it's a great device for backseat entertainment, for instance. if you're not a fan of apple products (hey, this is pcmag after all), look at low-cost, unlocked android phones that don't require a sim card. they can do everything a regular android phone, just over wi-fi. thinking about your kid's first phone do not buy your child an expensive, high-end smartphone. the wait until 8th campaign, which advocates only giving kids smartphones once they reach the 8th grade, makes some good arguments, although it too easily elides smartphones and social media, which are different things. the campaign's central point, though, is that younger kids generally only need phones for calling and limited texting. the best phone for tweens and younger is a simple voice phone, or a communication/tracking device like the republic wireless relay walkie-talkie, or lg's gizmogadget smartwatch. when you do step up to a smartphone, don't spend too much money. kids aren't responsible. that's part of what makes them kids. they'll lose phones, drop phones, soak phones, and break phones. assume it will happen. there are a ton of good phones in the $200 to $400 range that run relatively new, secure versions of their operating systems, aren't frustrating to use, and don't look shamefully uncool. there are even some good ones under $200. we are not going to get into the endless debate, never resolved, about cell phone radiation and kids, but many parents have expressed concern to us about it. the \"good\" news is that radiation concerns only really come into play when a phone is held right up to your head for long periods of time, and kids don't talk on the phone with their friends much any more: they text. short conversations with parents on a basic phone, for safety or logistical uses, won't hurt anyone. for longer conversations, get an inexpensive wired headset. whatever phone you get, make sure to get a nice, rugged case for it. my daughter has a samsung galaxy note 4 in an otterbox commuter case. she loves it. i didn't expect how creative she'd become with the s pen, constantly doodling and making notes. thanks to the pen, her galaxy note 4 isn't just a phone, it's an endless diary. the service plan question when you get your kid a phone, whether it's a new one or a hand-me-down, you have to address what service plan it'll be on. the lowest cost option is wi-fi-only, with no sim card. in that case, they only have coverage in known wi-fi networks, and can't send standard text messages or make regular phone calls. they can, however, use imessage and facetime on iphones, or google hangouts for texting and calling to other google accounts on android phones. your carrier may have a good or convenient deal to add a line, which may also mean that you can get a phone on a monthly payment plan. if you're sharing a data bucket with a child, make sure that to limit their line to a certain amount of monthly data so that they don't eat up all of yours. you may also be able to save money by connecting your child's phone to a low-cost service. take a look at our best cheap cell phone plans you never heard of. if your kid just wants texting, for instance, you can get a plan from us mobile with 100 minutes, 1,000 texts, and no data for $10 per month, less than what most add-a-line deals cost. then you don't have to worry about overages or about your own plan being used. how to make your kid's phone safe make a deal with your kid: if they get a phone, you get to look at it. i check my daughter's phone periodically. she's fine with that; that's the deal. i don't read her text messages, but she knows i have the option. take a look at our best parental control software roundup. android and ios both have some built-in parental controls. on both oses, you can block purchases (you should, immediately, because it's way too easy to buy things accidentally), as well as application usage or installation. google's family link software for android 7 phones gives you activity reports and lets you set screen time limits as well. there are some apps that are frequently used for cyberbullying, and should stay off of any child's phone. these apps tend to change a lot, as each new cohort of kids finds something new. the general rule is that anything with a social aspect, or anything that allows public posting, is potentially dangerous. you should be able to look through the apps on your kid's phone and see the sorts of messages that are being received. you may be thinking, \"what about kids sneaking and lying?\" if your kid is lying to you, it isn't the phone's fault. you have the power to take it away. the best phones for every age as a parent, i've tried to keep this list diverse, with low-cost phones, used phones, and new phones. whatever one you get, make sure to lock it down. ages 8 and under small children who need phones often need them because they have complex caregiving arrangements where they're handed off between adults. a phone can also be useful if your kid tends to get lost on the playground, or likes to run and hide. kids this young can't be trusted to hold onto a phone: they need simple, restricted-access devices that can't be lost and can only call their parents. we prefer wristwatch devices over clip-style, as it's harder to lose them. our favorite for kids under nine is the verizon lg gizmogadget, which looks like a wristwatch and can call and text a restricted set of numbers. it also has a couple of cute, fun features that stop just short of games. if you're not a verizon user, the republic wireless relay walkie-talkie is great for linking an individual parent and kid, and for kids with tight groups of best friends or group activities. we think it's best for ages seven to 12. ages 9 to 13 as tweens and young teens get their first bits of independence, they may need phones to tote around the neighborhood\u2014and to text their friends. yet tweens are still kids, and often can't be trusted with expensive devices. this is prime time to get your kid a voice phone. ideally, you want one that works on your carrier's 4g lte network, for the best coverage and voice quality. unfortunately, those can be hard to find. the kyocera cadence is a good choice on verizon. on at&t, the unlocked nokia 3310 3g is a good option. there is currently no good, affordable voice phone compatible with sprint, t-mobile, boost, or virgin, which is frustrating. users of those networks should consider getting a prepaid service that uses the at&t or verizon networks instead. low-cost or used smartphones are also good choices for this set. the moto e5 play works with all four us carrier networks, runs the latest version of android, and won't put you out more than a c-note. as mentioned earlier, my daughter uses an older samsung galaxy note 4. if you're an ios family, make sure to get an ios 11-compatible phone. the oldest, least expensive ios 11-compatible iphone is the iphone 5s, which you can find for under $200 at used-phone marketplaces like gazelle and glyde. don't buy an iphone 5 or 5c, as they'll get left behind by apps soon. ages 14 to 17 teens' smartphone needs are much more like ours, although, of course, they're still often a little irresponsible. always make sure to turn on location tracking for your teen's phone as soon as they set it up, whether that's in your google account, samsung account, or icloud account. that will really help when your kid's phone is left behind at a party or school event, and they panic. you might be able to avoid some costly phone replacements by getting a waterproof or less fragile phone. the moto z2 force is water resistant and has a nearly unbreakable screen. samsung's active series, including the galaxy s7 active and galaxy s8 active, are both water resistant and slightly ruggedized. the lg g6, v30, and g7 thinq are all waterproof, although they aren't ruggedized. with iphones, get an iphone 7 for the best balance of price and water resistance. all are high-quality options that older teens won't be ashamed to carry around. view as: one pageslides              share tweet pin email   apple iphone 7  apple's iphone 7 is the current best iphone choice for teens, as it balances power, waterproofing, and price.     at              share tweet pin email   kyocera cadence lte  the kyocera cadence lte, on verizon, is the best simple voice phone on the market right now, and it makes an excellent first phone for kids.     at              share tweet pin email   lg gizmogadget

wireless relay  the republic wireless relay is a screenless cellular communications gadget that can keep kids in touch with their parents and friends; think of it more as a walkie-talkie than a phone.

on the left, along with a sim/microsd card slot.        7right the recessed power button on the right doubles as a fingerprint sensor.        8120hz screen the 120hz screen allows for smoother gameplay.         9speakers a pair of loud stereo speakers on the top and bottom of the phone make for thunderous audio.        10cortex not all games support 120hz, but the cortex app can point you toward the ones that do.        11game settings the cortex app also lets you tweak the settings of each individual game, controlling clock speed, resolution, and screen refresh rate.        12chroma

moto e5 play review                         sascha segan      apple or android? big, small, stock, or skinned, if you're in the market for a new smartphone, chances are there's an android option to fit your fancy. and unlike apple's rigid release cycle, google's hardware partners unleash a seemingly endless stream of new devices year-round. but therein lies the problem: with so many options out there, how do you settle on the right one? lucky for you, we test and review nearly every smartphone available on all the major us carriers. keep in mind that while the reviews above may not show your carrier of choice, most of the phones here are available for, or compatible with, multiple us carriers. read on for what to look for when buying, as well as our top picks for android phones. when to buy a new android phone most of this year's big releases are on this list already. the few we're still waiting to review are lg's v40 and huawei's mate 20, both of which have unusual arrays of cameras, and the oneplus 6t. those will be on the market by early november. after that, we expect the android phone market to stay pretty stable until we see the lg v8 and the samsung galaxy s10 around april 2019. pricing trends this list has phones from $59 to $1,100. but most of the phones here are either quite cheap, or very expensive. readers from countries outside the us, where $300 to $400 phones are popular, will probably be pretty curious about that.  relatively few phones in the us sell with list prices between $250 and $500. that's because most phones here are sold on monthly payment plans that hide the upfront price of the phone. people who don't have sufficient credit to go for a monthly payment plan, in general, purchase phones that cost under $200 upfront. there are some exceptions to this rule\u2014people do buy a limited amount of unlocked galaxy s9 phones and iphones with full payment\u2014but the prevalence of monthly payment plans has largely killed the $300 to $500 segment. we've put the lg g6, one of last year's flagships, on this list to fulfill people who are looking for a phone in the $300 to $500 range. what size phone is right for you? there's been a dramatic shift in android phone shapes and sizes over the last year. lg and samsung have both started to make their phones taller and narrower, resulting in one-hand-friendly models with improbably large screen sizes. we go into more detail on the new form factors in this is how we need to measure phone screens now. you can find android phones with stated screen sizes from 4.6 inches up to 6-plus inches. with the new form factors, though, it's very important to look at the width of the phone as well as the width of the screen. that's how the biggest screen in our list, the 6.4-inch panel on the samsung galaxy note 9, doesn't overwhelm. which is the best android version? not all android is created equal. device manufacturers like htc and samsung have been applying their own visions to android for some time now. if you want a pure google experience, then you want to go for a pixel device; they're the developer models where google makes sure to deploy upgrades first. motorola and oneplus also have very clean user interfaces, although they tend to add more invisible features to android. the newest version of android is 9.0 pie, which is available only for the google pixel phones, oneplus phones, and the essential phone at the moment. the essential phone isn't on this list because the company seems perpetually on the verge of going out of business, which makes us feel uneasy about recommending it. for most other phones, android 8.0 oreo is the current shipping version, and you should find it on most phones today. do not accept any phone with a version older than 7.0 nougat, as the older the android software version gets, the more likely it is to have serious security flaws.  the ongoing trade war we've frequently recommended phones from the huawei, honor, and zte brands in the past\u2014they're often high-quality products that are great value for the money. but over the past year, the us government has essentially gone to war with those companies, making their future on the us market extremely unreliable. so for now, we've eased away from reviewing most huawei, honor, and zte products until their distribution in the us is clearer. see how we test phones because we know we have many readers in the uk and canada, though, we've included one huawei phone on this list\u2014the extraordinary p20 pro. while we do not generally review or include phones not available in the us, the p20 pro shows what we're missing out on. should you buy through a carrier or unlocked? the us market is still dominated by carrier-sold phones, but a new breed of high-quality unlocked options are starting to flood the market. some high-quality android phones are available completely unlocked for around $250, no strings attached. every phone on this list can be bought direct, with no carrier involvement. but most people still buy their phones through carriers, which offer a single point for service and support, as well as monthly payment plans that dramatically lower the upfront prices of phones. of the bunch shown here, the galaxies, motorolas, and the pixel work on all four major us carriers. the lg g6 doesn't work on sprint. most other unlocked phones only work on at&t, t-mobile, or virtual carriers on those networks. choosing android as your mobile operating system is only half the battle. if you're still on the fence, check out our list of the 10 best smartphones, regardless of os. for help choosing a carrier, see our test results for the fastest mobile networks and the best cheap cell phone plans you've never heard of.  the

our hands around its smaller sibling. the pixel 3 xl is a big, powerful pure android phone that puts all things google front and center, though we prefer wrapping our hands around its smaller sibling.     oct. 16, 2018   ajay kumar       for once bigger isn't better. the google pixel 3 xl is the 6.3-inch phablet-sized version of google's new flagship phone. on paper, it has all the ingredients for greatness, including a sharp quad hd oled screen, the latest specs, impressive camera performance, and useful new ai-powered functionality. but at $899.99 for the 64gb model or $999.99 for 128gb, it's more expensive than the pixel 3, which doesn't have a notch in its screen and we feel is a lot more comfortable to handle. unless you're a big-screen diehard, we recommend the more compact and affordable pixel 3 over the xl. different bodies and screens the pixel 3 xl is essentially the same handset as the pixel 3, so see our review of that phone for specifics related to hardware and software performance. here we're going to discuss what's different between the two phones and why that matters. the biggest difference between the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 xl is size. the pixel 3 xl measures 6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches (hwd) and weighs 6.5 ounces, making it the same size as (but lighter than) the apple iphone xs max (6.2 by 3.0 by 0.3 inches, 7.3 ounces), and smaller than the samsung galaxy note 9 (6.4 by 3.0 by 0.4 inches, 7.1 ounces). it's just a bit too wide for me, though i know plenty of people out there like big phones. still, it's hard to reach across the screen with your thumb, and despite the relatively minor bezel, it's difficult to reach up and pull down the notification shade.   view all 27 photos in gallery    obviously the pixel 3 xl has a bigger screen than the pixel 3, but it's also sharper. it boasts a crisp 6.3-inch quad hd oled display with a 2,960-by-1,440 resolution in an 18.5:9 aspect ratio. this works out to 523 pixels per inch, sharper than the pixel 3 (443ppi), the iphone xs max (458ppi) and the galaxy note 9 (516ppi). according to dr. ray soneira at displaymate labs, the pixel 3 xl has a top-tier display with excellent calibration accuracy and performance that is \"visually indistinguishable from perfect.\" it falls into the same category as the galaxy note 9, the galaxy s9, and the iphone x/xs max, earning a displaymate best smartphone display award, with each screen standing out for its own particular strengths. the one downside is that the xl has a big notch at the top, which i find distracting because of how deep it is. it notably cuts into content when scrolling web pages or using apps. google has promised you'll be able to \"disable\" it by blacking out the sides, but that raises the question of why it's there in the first place. in my opinion, the pixel 3 manages things a bit more gracefully with some extra bezel at the top of the screen in lieu of a notch. the stereo speakers seem a bit louder here than on the smaller pixel 3, though there's not an appreciable difference.  a lot of the same both phones have the same qualcomm snapdragon 845 processor and 4gb of ram, though you'll see some minor variation in benchmarks and graphics tests due to the pixel 3 xl's more demanding quad hd screen. in pcmark's work 2.0 test it scored 9,191, a bit lower than the pixel 3 (9,358) but still much higher than the note 9 (7,662). it handles demanding games like asphalt 8 just fine, though in gfxbench it scored 20fps in the car chase on-screen test, which is notably lower than the pixel 3 (33fps). multitasking, launching new apps, and scrolling web pages is fast and responsive. left to right: pixel 3 xl, pixel 3 as far as the camera sensors and software go, both phones are exactly the same. they excel in capturing detail, they have a digital zoom enhancement that practically matches phones with telephoto zoom, they're great at snapping bokeh shots, and they boast dual wide-angle selfie cameras that can capture more of your background.  see how we test cell phones the pixel 3 xl has a 3,430mah battery that lasted for 8 hours, 10 minutes while streaming video over wi-fi at maximum screen brightness. that's a bit better than the 7 hours, 57 minutes managed by the 2,915mah pixel 3, but the difference is fairly negligible. both can take advantage of fast charging with the included 18w adapter or wireless charging with the 10w pixel stand or other qi-enabled charging accessories.  the pixel 3 xl runs a pure version of android 9.0 pie with at least two years of guaranteed updates. there's no bloatware aside from google's app suite. out of 64gb of storage on our review unit, we had 51.05gb free for use. purchasing either pixel gets you unlimited lifetime google photo storage. conclusions the google pixel 3 xl has all the power of the pixel 3 in a larger form factor. if you like big phones, the pixel 3 xl is plenty capable of justifying its $900 starting price. for $100 less, however, we prefer the standard pixel 3's more hand-friendly design, especially considering it shares the same powerful hardware and camera capabilities. we're seeing far fewer one-handed android phones these days, and so the standard pixel 3 earns our editors' choice. as far as phablets go, we also like the lg v40 thinq for its triple-sensor camera and the galaxy note 9 for its tremendous battery life and excellent note-taking capabilities. for fans of apple's design and software ecosystem, the iphone xs max is a strong, albeit even more costly alternative. for pure google, however, you can't beat the pixel 3 xl.   google pixel 3 xl   excellent             at     bottom line: the pixel 3 xl is a big, powerful pure android phone that puts all things google front and center, though we prefer wrapping our hands around its smaller sibling.    top comparisons       lg g6 vs. samsung galaxy s8        apple iphone 5s vs. apple iphone 6        samsung

certification labs, meaning the unlocked device will be the first oneplus phone to run on the us's largest wireless carrier.       it's a green light for big red at oneplus. sources told us today that the upcoming oneplus 6t phone has passed verizon's certification labs, meaning that the unlocked model of the new cult smartphone will be the first oneplus phone to run on the us's largest wireless carrier. last week, we reported that oneplus was seeking verizon certification, and it has now, apparently, received the sign-off. verizon certification helps oneplus avoid embarrassing missteps like we're seeing with the razer phone 2\u2014razer initially said it would be verizon-compatible, but at launch it was not; according to razer's ceo, it might be in the future. the link-up with verizon is part of a two-pronged expansion plan for oneplus in the us. my sources tell me that most of oneplus's energy is tied up in a major partnership with t-mobile, which will become clearer when the phone launches on monday, oct. 29. most americans who aren't phone geeks would become aware of oneplus through its connection with t-mobile, and most phones will be sold on t-mobile payment plans. choosier consumers who buy unlocked phones online, though, will now have both verizon and at&t as network options. more importantly for oneplus, this gives the company experience with verizon's labs and certification processes, meaning that oneplus may be preparing to sell a future phone with verizon. that future verizon phone may be the 5g device coming in 2019, which oneplus co-founder carl pei mentioned on stage this weekend at qualcomm's 4g/5g summit in hong kong, and which co-founder pete lau presaged on stage with me in june at mobile world congress shanghai. the upcoming oneplus 6t will have a bunch of changes from the existing oneplus 6. oneplus is getting rid of the headphone jack, and including an under-display fingerprint sensor. rumors say the phone's price may be getting a hike, too, although it will still be at least $200 less expensive than other major manufacturers' flagships. if you're curious about more oneplus 6t features, 9to5google has a perfectly good rumor

5g phones further with new antenna modules  by          sascha segan       oct. 23, 2018, 10 a.m.  qualcomm's new modules make it more likely that we'll see flagship 5g android phones from samsung and lg, for at&t; and verizon, early next year.       with a slew of 5g flagship phones expected in the first half of next year, the components needed to make them work are getting better pretty fast. only a few months after announcing the first antenna modules that could fit at&t's and verizon's 5g into a phone, qualcomm today announced new modules that are 25 percent smaller and could support both carriers' networks in the same device. while t-mobile and sprint are running 5g on existing cellular bands, at&t and verizon are relying on super-high-speed millimeter wave spectrum, which is going to need multiple arrays of many tiny antennas on each phone. we saw the first modules with those antennas back in july. they're already pretty small\u2014less than the length running from the tip of your finger to the first knuckle\u2014so even smaller is, well, really small. at&t and verizon are also using different frequency bands\u2014verizon is on 28ghz while at&t is on 39ghz. last month at mobile world congress americas, at&t exec gordon mansfield warned us that the first round of 5g devices might not be able to handle both bands, making them essentially locked to one wireless carrier. the new, smaller module \"is engineered to enable mobile device manufacturers to address stringent mobile handset size requirements,\" qualcomm said in a press release. in other words, it lets companies make relatively small 5g nr phones. qualcomm's press release for the new modules promises support for at&t's, verizon's, and european millimeter-wave configurations. qualcomm marketing director bassil elkadi said in an email that \"there are skus that support both 28 and 39 (so it will enable the same device sku to use both 28/39),\" which means that devices built with the new module could work with both at&t and verizon, if device manufacturers decide to take that path. in any case, this module really helps tee off what's going to surely be a big 2019 for 5g smartphone launches. at mobile world congress shanghai, oneplus ceo pete lau already told us he's working on a 5g phone for early next year, and i think this raises the chance the samsung galaxy s10 or lg g8 could have 5g, as well. we may hear about those phones at mwc 2019, in late february.        next article    more inside pcmag.com rockstar strongly recommends red dead redemption 2 launch patch

oneplus to move 6t launch to oct. 29  by          sascha segan       oct. 20, 2018, 4 a.m.  apple stepped all over oneplus's oct. 30 launch event, scheduling its huge ipad-and-mac extravaganza an hour before oneplus was scheduled to show off its device.       oneplus blinked. it had to. the company's new oneplus 6t phone could be a big deal for the us, with potential t-mobile sales, verizon compatibility, and an under-the-screen fingerprint sensor. but yesterday, apple stepped all over oneplus's oct. 30 launch event, scheduling its huge ipad-and-mac extravaganza an hour before oneplus was scheduled to show off its device. that put oneplus in a real bind. \"we were dealt a pretty bad hand,\" the company said in a post on its community forums today. \"for months on end, hundreds of people have poured their hearts and souls into creating our best product to date. our goal is to make sure it gets the time and attention it deserves.\" so the phone maker today announced that it's moving the 6t launch back to oct. 29 at 11 a.m. the company will refund tickets or help change travel arrangements for any fans who purchased tickets to the event, it says. apple is a trillion-dollar company that tends to suck all of the media air out of any room. shifting away from trying to compete head-to-head in a launch event is a smart idea, because it will let oneplus get the news coverage it needs to really compete where it matters: on retail shelves. now it's apple vs. oneplus at t-mobile oneplus could become a key lower-cost rival for apple at t-mobile, which just introduced three-year payment plans that lower the apparent cost of iphones, baystreet research founder cliff maldonado told us. those three-year payment plans are really going to squeeze android makers, maldonado said. on a 36-month plan, an iphone xr will cost only $20.83 per month, so it'll be advertised at the same monthly price as a $500 phone on a two-year plan.  android makers' problem is that their phones often don't last three years without degrading in performance, maldonado said, so android manufacturers will need to pitch their devices as more affordable and easier to upgrade. enter oneplus. \"samsung isn't winning. it's losing to apple, and the pixel just hurt samsung,\" maldonado said. \"but who's going to come in and say, my phone is cheaper, but you can upgrade it every two years?\" we'll see, now on oct. 29.      next article    more inside pcmag.com rockstar strongly recommends red dead redemption 2 launch patch google's stance on sexual harassment is facing questions

news      pcmag asia     apple iphone xs max                    the 5g laptop won't need storage  by          sascha segan       oct. 20, 2018, 1:36 a.m.  at the launch of the latest qualcomm-powered windows machine, i talked to qualcomm, samsung, and microsoft about the future of connected laptops.       the samsung galaxy book2 is prologue. the latest lte-enabled laptop, which promises 20-plus hours of battery life running full windows applications on its qualcomm snapdragon 850 processor, combines an \"it's always ready\" smartphone feeling with the \"it can do anything\" ability of real windows. that is if the wireless carriers let this innovation happen. next year we'll start seeing 5g networks from all four nationwide us carriers\u2014and the first 5g-enabled laptops for those networks, probably. so i asked don mcguire, qualcomm's vp of global product marketing, microsoft's vp of device sales carlos de torres, and samsung svp alanna cotton how the galaxy book2 presages the kinds of machines we'll use in the 5g world. start with the galaxy book2's always-connected nature, and work out from there. cotton points out \"it's going to a more connected world, where people can do whatever they want from whenever they want.\" a 4g laptop gets you to being able to send, receive, and browse anywhere at any time. 5g may put more parts of your computer itself into the cloud. what will 5g laptops look like? the galaxy book2 is slim and light, with long battery life and quick wake times. that's a start. but i think it's only the beginning of the upcoming 5g laptop transformation. 5g networks aren't just a faster form of cellular networking. they're much lower latency, meaning they feel radically more responsive, and they have much greater capacity, meaning data caps and throttling may be a thing of the past. ideally, 5g also requires zero user configuration after initial setup. this means you don't need to worry about devices being paired over bluetooth or connected to the same wi-fi network, for instance, and that cloud data will feel very much like local data.  on his book2 screen (of course) torres sketched out a picture of the \"intelligent edge\"\u2014basically, different devices you own being able to interact and exchange data effortlessly using 5g connections. with very low latency, remote storage will feel like local storage, and wireless devices will feel like wired peripherals. that's going to affect laptop design. it takes us back to a very old idea of thin clients, where a lot of processing gets done off-device, and input and output become the priorities in device design: displays, speakers, keyboards. unlike the old thin-client terminals, though, endless battery life and maximum wireless reception also become priorities. laptops may also prioritize cpu over gpu as more games become streamed or partially rendered in the cloud. this is subtly different from the browser-based chromebook model, because it's not necessarily about moving the application to the cloud as much as moving the data there. but yeah, sure, chromebooks and windows laptops are converging here.  you can see these priorities shifting, already, in the galaxy book2. the laptop has 4gb of ram and 128gb of storage. that's not a lot. but it has that super amoled screen, and it comes with its keyboard and pen where the microsoft surface charges extra for those accessories. where would samsung put its money if it didn't have to invest in storage? screens, it sounds like. the galaxy book2's $999 price is unusually low for a laptop with a punchy super amoled screen, something cotton just chalked up to the natural reductions in price you see as technologies get more popular. somewhere within samsung, somebody made the decision to not spend money on things that could be offloaded to the cloud, and to give you input and output tools instead. \"the screen is what consumers are telling us they need more of, a big purchase driver,\" cotton said. the problem is the carriers (as usual) the galaxy book2 launch was missing one thing: wireless carriers. the laptop will be sold by at&t, sprint, and verizon, none of which were present at the launch. they're the gatekeepers to the cloud we need for the always-connected laptop dream to happen, and they seem determined to make connecting to that cloud difficult, awkward, and expensive. the technology is there to make always-connected laptops much easier to use. the carriers just don't seem to want that to happen. the book2 has an embedded esim, which could be switched between carriers using an app. microsoft has software to let people sign up for data plans on the fly. in europe and brazil, mcguire and torres said, you can sign up for \"snackable\" data packages of whatever you need, when you need it. that won't be the case here. galaxy book2 units in the us will only work with physical sims provided by at&t, sprint, and verizon, on traditional service plans. the assembled execs tried not to disparage their carrier partners, but expressed hope that apple's move to esims in the iphone xs max will loosen the regime up a bit. \"we would not have gotten this far without direct engagement with our telecom partners,\" cotton said. \"from a us perspective, being able to have channel engagement with partners is so important. we can't separate the device from connectivity.\" existing connected-device service plans aren't terribly visionary. on verizon, for example, the rates are relatively high and data buckets low for always-connected use: 4gb for $40 or 6gb for $50, for instance. for what it's worth, baystreet research founder cliff maldonado told me he doesn't think carriers are trying to sandbag connected laptops on purpose. they are likely still finalizing their 5g pricing plans, as well as billing and sales systems, to offer the kinds of on-demand plans that laptop users will want, he said. i'm going to use the galaxy book2 as my secondary laptop for a while, and see if my world changes if i don't need to worry about plugging in or attaching to wi-fi. qualcomm, microsoft, and samsung have teed something up; now let's see if our carriers can let us take a good swing at this ball.  apple iphone xs ...     next article    more inside pcmag.com ios 12.1 fixes the iphone smooth skin selfie problem apple reveals iphone xr repair prices

   pcmag asia     asus zenfone v                    oneplus 6t phone may work on verizon  by          sascha segan       oct. 18, 2018, 9 p.m.  the upcoming oneplus 6t phone may be the first oneplus phone to work on verizon's network, if our sources are correct. until now, oneplus phones have only run on at&t; and t-mobile.       take this with a grain of salt, but according to multiple different industry sources i've talked to recently, the upcoming oneplus 6t may be the first oneplus phone to work on the verizon network. cult smartphone maker oneplus gets great reviews, but it hasn't broken into the us mainstream yet because of a lack of carrier relationships. we've already heard that the company is working to try to get the phone sold by t-mobile, which would be a match made in heaven, brand-wise. getting into t-mobile stores, with monthly payment plans, would finally expose oneplus to the vast majority of americans who buy their phones through their carriers. but oneplus will still sell a model of its phone direct, carrier-free, and unlocked, and making that phone work on verizon would give the company much greater flexibility. until now, oneplus phones have only run on the at&t and t-mobile networks. is it certified? verizon couldn't accept many unlocked phones for years because it used the 2g cdma radio system, which doesn't work with most unlocked devices. but the company has started accepting lte-only phones such as the asus zenfone v, which don't have cdma. the oneplus 6t would probably be an lte-only phone on verizon. verizon's lte coverage now exceeds its old cdma coverage, and its lte voice quality is much better than cdma voice quality, so nothing's really lost. my sources say that the 6t will have lte band 13, which is critical for good verizon compatibility. the question is whether the phone will be properly certified; from what i hear, verizon's labs are still working on this. twice now, we've seen manufacturers claim that their phones were verizon-compatible, only to have them run into configuration roadblocks. both the htc one a9 and the zte axon 7 were initially verizon compatible on paper, but htc withdrew support for verizon's network, and the zte phone became wildly unreliable when verizon pushed various software updates through its system. the upcoming oneplus 6t, launching on oct. 30, will have a bunch of changes from the existing oneplus 6. oneplus is getting rid of the headphone jack, and including an under-display fingerprint sensor. rumors say the phone's price may be getting a hike, too. if you're curious about more oneplus 6t features, 9to5google has a perfectly good rumor roundup. in the us, wider carrier availability will probably be the most meaningful change for this phone. oneplus products generally get good reviews, but with 85-88 percent of us phones sold on carrier shelves, it has to get carrier promotion to become a major player. if the t-mobile deal goes through, that'll really help. but there's also a growing lack of high-quality, mid-priced phone options at verizon as flagship phones get more and more expensive. the lg g7 and iphone xr are both about $750, and the samsung galaxy s9 and google pixel 3 are $799. other flagships are even more expensive. then there's a big gap in current models before dropping to the $480 moto z3. if oneplus manages to fit neatly in there, it'll be a great option for verizon users looking for a replacement phone.  asus zenfone vgoogle pixel 3     next article    more inside pcmag.com rockstar strongly recommends red dead redemption 2

          5 ways customer service will change by 2022 so long, mobile apps  5 ways customer service will change by 2022 in the not too distant future, how would you like to be served?       juan martinez         feb. 23, 2018, 3:50 a.m.           5   if you haven\u2019t already noticed, the way in which you interact with customer service representatives has changed dramatically over the past five years. five years ago, you may have spoken on the phone with a customer service rep or emailed with one, whereas today you\u2019re more likely to get answers to questions via chatbots or virtual voice assistants. according to gartner research, more than half of organizations have already invested in virtual customer assistant applications for customer service. those that have implemented these solutions have reported a reduction of up to 70 percent of call, chat, or email inquiries. based on its interactions with brands and its own in-house research, gartner has come up with five critical ways that customer service will be different within the next five years. \"as more customers engage on digital channels, virtual customer assistants [vcas] are being implemented for handling customer requests on websites, mobile apps, consumer messaging apps, and social networks,\" said gene alvarez, managing vice president at gartner, while speaking at the gartner customer experience summit in tokyo. \"this is underpinned by improvements in natural language processing [nlp], machine learning [ml], and intent-matching capabilities.\" in this article, we\u2019ll examine the five major changes coming to customer service and how your business can take advantage of them.this article originally appeared on pcmag.com.        1so long, mobile apps by 2019, 20 percent of brands will abandon their mobile apps, gartner predicts. because of a lack of adoption and engagement, brands are instead turning to messaging apps for platforms such as facebook and wechat, where they\u2019ll be able to reach customers should issues occur or questions arise. by doing this, the companies can avoid spending money on support, maintenance, upgrades, and marketing in order to maximize the value of a mobile app.companies such as verizon are working on technology that may help save the mobile app from such a disastrous fate. verizon\u2019s visual interactive calling lets customers click a call button within the mobile app that launches a conversation with a customer service rep. as the rep, you're then able to instantly see whose account you're dealing with, what page you\u2019re on inside the app, and where the issue might be.        2it and customer service join forces back when the phone was the main channel for customer support, it and customer service professionals didn\u2019t feel the need to closely align planning and workflow processes. that\u2019s not the case anymore. according to gartner, the proportion of projects using it to improve the customer experience will steadily rise, with more than 66 percent of all customer experience projects making use of it by 2022.in fact, a recent spiceworks study shows that that it decision makers are steadily ceding purchasing power to business decision makers who are more focused on reaching the customer and simplifying business processes that may have traditionally fallen out of the purview of it.        3artificial intelligence for sales according to gartner, 30 percent of all business-to-business (b2b) companies will use artificial intelligence (ai) to drive at least one primary sales process by 2020. the report projects that ai will let sales teams more efficiently and effectively manage business processes, especially those dealing with high volumes of leads, opportunities, and forecasting.zoho zia and salesforce einstein are perhaps the most well-known ai bots built into customer relationship management (crm) tools. in the case of zoho, zia is engineered to detect system usage anomalies, suggest optimal workflows and macros, and advise salespeople on when to contact a prospect. zia generates suggestions based on a salesperson's crm usage patterns, including what's been working well, what hasn't been working well, and what the sales rep can do to improve crm use.similarly, einstein uses analytics and ai to give salespeople tools to prioritize deals and leads, predict sales pipeline revenue, and surface important emails with proactive recommendations.        4a marriage between analytics and customers although analytics have been used to enhance business processes in almost all facets of your company, understanding how the customer feels about your brand hasn\u2019t been possible outside of monitoring mentions on social media. according to gartner, how much a customer trusts your organization plays a key role in whether or not they intend to keep shopping with you. as a result, more than 40 percent of all data analytics projects will focus directly on the customer experience by 2020.within the analytics bracket, brands are finding ways to predict customer interest before the customer proactively engages with the brand and then to use that data to make offers. brands have also turned analytics into a teaching tool to help employees improve performance at all customer touchpoints. simple things such as website monitoring and social media marketing are being driven by analytics, not just because they help sharpen internal operations, but also because the way in which you present your organization to customers is what will ultimately determine if they shop with you again.         5ar, vr, and mr enter the mainstream if you\u2019ve ever played pokemon go , then you\u2019ve already immersed yourself in the joys of augmented reality (ar). however, brands are now beginning to think about how they\u2019ll revamp their businesses by using ar, virtual reality (vr), and mixed reality (mr) to help train and educate employees or suppliers as well as provide customers with more realistic environments in which to test new products and experiences. want to see how a sofa in a storeroom fits in your apartment? strap on a headset. want to see what being on a carnival cruise is like? step on up to the vr headset.as a result of these capabilities, gartner predicts that by 2020 at least 20 percent of large companies will have made ar, vr, and mr part of their digital strategy. last year, when we spoke with e-commerce experts about how consumers would shop by the year 2025, our experts noted several current examples of shopping in ar, vr, and mr. they cited ikea place and the houzz mobile app as examples of current tools that let shoppers visualize furniture in their homes before buying.          related galleries 5 ways to make your

youtube ads to mine cryptocurrency  by          michael kan       jan. 27, 2018, 9:06 a.m.  the ads largely arrived on wednesday and ended up stealing the computing power from victims' pcs through their browsers.       this week, ads over youtube carried a sneaky surprise: a cryptocurrency miner. the mining software briefly invaded the video platform in an attempt to secretly siphon the computing power from any youtube viewers who encountered the ads.  the culprit? hackers who decided to abuse google's ad network. the bad actors seeded the advertisements with web scripts that'll run over your browser to mine the digital currency monero. the ads largely arrived on wednesday and ended up spreading to victims based in japan, france, taiwan, italy and spain, according to the security firm trend micro. twitter users noticed the problem too. they've posted screenshots of their antivirus software detecting the mining scripts.  hey @avast_antivirus seems that you are blocking crypto miners (#coinhive) in @youtube #adsthank you :)https://t.co/p2jjwnqyxz \u2014 diego betto (@diegobetto) january 25, 2018   the same form me. maybe youtube is using coinhive . com ? pic.twitter.com/gusitbp1tm \u2014 neretva (@neretva2010) january 24, 2018  the hackers probably targeted youtube because the platform is so popular, trend micro said in a friday blog post. the more browsers the mining software can leverage, the more cryptocurrency it can generate. however, the mining comes with a cost: it can hog your pc's computer resources, and drag down the performance. in this case, the mining scripts in the youtube scheme were configured to siphon 80 percent of the pc's computing power, trend micro said. google, which owns youtube, has taken action. on friday, the company claimed that the ads were blocked in less than two hours. the bad actors have also been removed from google's platforms. \"mining cryptocurrency through ads is a relatively new form of abuse that violates our policies  and one that we've been monitoring actively,\" a company spokesperson said on friday in an email. unfortunately, cryptocurrency mining that creeps through your browser is probably here to stay. in recent months, hackers have been hijacking websites, and even chrome browser extensions, to seed them with web scripts that can mine the digital currency monero, which is now worth $320 a coin.  many of these hacks all have something in common: they've relied on a service called coinhive to do the mining. since sept, coinhive has been offering a javascript monero miner that anyone can register to use and slip into a website. in return, coinhive takes a 30 percent cut. wednesday's youtube scheme pulled from the same playbook; it too used a coinhive script in about 90 percent of the ads served. the remaining ads employed a private web miner. so far, coinhive hasn't commented on the youtube scheme. but its mining script has become widespread. many anti-virus vendors including trend micro are starting to rank it as among the most pervasive malware threats circulating on the web.      next article    more inside pcmag.com google's stance on sexual harassment is

spyware can steal your whatsapp messages  by          michael kan       jan. 17, 2018, 6 a.m.  the skygofree spyware is probably an 'offensive' surveillance product from a developer in italy, according to kaspersky lab.       security researchers have uncovered new android spyware with never-before-seen functions, like the ability to steal your whatsapp messages. kaspersky lab spotted the spyware, dubbed skygofree, and called it one of the most powerful espionage tools for android the company has ever seen. it has been active since 2014, and once installed, it can secretly take pictures, record videos, and seize data from your phone. although whatsapp is built with end-to-end encryption, the spyware can still lift messages from the app. it does so by exploiting android's accessibility services to read the content displayed over the messaging service. another never-before-seen feature is the spyware's ability to eavesdrop on the victim when the device enters certain locations. kaspersky lab said fake webpages pretending to be mobile carriers have been tricking victims into installing the spyware. \"download the update now and keep on navigating at maximum speed!\" the fake webpages claim. however, the spyware doesn't appear to be from cybercriminals. it probably belongs to a cyber-surveillance company based in italy, according to kaspersky lab. the spyware contains several references to the term \"negg,\" which is also the name of an it company based in rome. so far, the italian company hasn't commented on kaspersky's research. according to its website, negg is a cybersecurity provider that develops applications for mobile devices. kaspersky refrained from naming negg as the culprit behind the spyware, but said the spyware is possibly an \"offensive\" security product. its developer may have very well been following in the footsteps of hacking team, another italian security company known for selling surveillance tech to law enforcement and governments, kaspersky added. the good news is that most consumers will probably never encounter the skygofree spyware. the victims have so far been exclusively based in italy, according to kaspersky lab. nevertheless, the malicious code goes to show how powerful digital espionage tools have become. to protect yourself, it's best to avoid opening attachments or visiting download links from senders you don't know. antivirus software can also detect various forms of spyware.      next article    more inside pcmag.com rockstar strongly recommends red dead redemption 2

'become too cluttered' as of late.       facebook messenger is getting a makeunder. in a tuesday blog post, facebook messenger head davis marcus admitted that the app has \"become too cluttered\" as of late. \"over the last two years, we built a lot of capabilities to find the features that continue to set us apart. a lot of them have found their product market fit; some haven't,\" he wrote. \"expect to see us invest in massively simplifying and streamlining messenger this year.\" marcus didn't offer up any specifics as to how facebook plans to pare down the app. he did, however, say messenger get more visual messaging options this year, additional group chat features, and new ways to interact with businesses. the company also plans to \"continue investing in real time communications\" features, like voice and video chat, to help people stay connected via messenger. at this point, some 1.3 billion people use messenger every month, marcus wrote. in 2017, messenger users sent more than 500 billion emoji, 18 billion gifs, and had 17 billion video chats. businesses have launched more than 200,000 chatbots on the platform. meanwhile, facebook last month released a version of the messenger app for kids. the messenger kids ios app can be installed on a child's apple smartphone or tablet, but controlled from a parent's facebook account. the company also recently added support for 4k photos. news of the impending facebook messenger overhaul comes after snapchat in late november announced a major redesign, which will separate content from friends and content from publishers, as part of an effort to make the app easier for newbies to understand. facebook itself is also planning some big changes, which will likely cause page admins to see a drop in engagement. the social network last week announced plans to start showing users more posts from family, friends, and groups they are part of, and less content from businesses, brands, and media organizations.      next article    more inside pcmag.com google's stance on sexual harassment is facing questions china: to avoid spying, trump should swap iphone for a huawei cathay pacific

steal, easier to forget, and they create work for your staff. what's worse is that they're not really very good security for all sorts of reasons. but for now, we're stuck with them. fortunately, there are things that you can do to reduce your risk, and more importantly, increase your level of compliance with requirements ranging from the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa) to the sarbanes\u2013oxley act (sox). but you also need to do it in a way that doesn't add to your management burden more than necessary and that doesn't cost too much. and, of course, it needs to work in all the places where your employees work. before you rush into a search for password alternatives, however, it's probably a good idea to give some thought to your password policies, remembering that they need to be used by people. this means that requiring passwords that are too long or too complex will actually decrease their effectiveness in addition to increasing the cost to you. their effectiveness is reduced because people write them down so they won't forget, or they forget and your it department has to perform a reset, which costs you money. or you need to add a \"forgot your password\" feature, which has its own set of risks and complexities. you also need to think about your requirements for routine password changes. a number of studies indicate that they're probably not necessary and that they have the same downsides as overly complex or long passwords, except that they happen more often. but even with a rational password policy, this still isn't a very good way to maintain your compliance level. clearly you need something else. this is where a second authentication factor comes in.      second authentication factors       for large organizations where most employees work in the office, the most obvious solution is to use the id badge as a second factor. in nearly all cases, including the government and many fortune 500 companies, this means adopting the smart card as that second factor. this isn't a new approach and it's widely used. the difference is that the cost of entry is now vastly lower because windows 10 now includes support for smart cards as a security technology. but smart cards aren't necessarily the best solution for every company and they're not a solution at all for a mostly mobile workforce. while you can buy laptops with an integrated smart card reader, you're not going to find this as easy to accomplish with your employees who use smartphones or tablets as part of their work. the obvious solution for mobile users might be to adopt a different form of two-factor authentication (2fa), such as sending out a numeric code using sms. every phone that's currently available supports text messaging, and while it entails a brief delay in access while users wait for a text message to arrive, it actually works well and it's secure since modern phones usually require a biometric log-in or their own passcode before they will work. but to be even safer, it's possible to use a dedicated application to gain access to your data systems. the challenge there is, you'll need to develop an app for each type of smartphone your employees use. you could also use a web app but then you're back to the password problem again, unless you're prepared to do some web development that would allow authentication via your employee smartphones, which is not impossible but also not trivial. by now you might be wondering about those whole-hand print readers you see at some data centers or you might be thinking about fingerprint or retinal scan readers. those all can work well and they're an obvious solution for a high-value installation, such as your data center. but they require a significant investment in infrastructure and they require people to manage them. we're trying to think about ways to improve compliance without adding people or spending too much money.            other ways to improve compliance what this means is that you'll need to take more than one approach. for your office workers, you might implement smart cards as a factor in authenticating your employees. this has advantages for physical security in addition to helping your compliance, and the cost of entry is within the reach of even smaller organizations. for reference, smart card readers that work with windows are available in quantities of one for about $10. keyboards with integrated smart card readers cost as little as $25 in quantities of one. for your mobile users, you may want to think about using sms messages for 2fa. this is something that you've certainly seen already, whether you're working with apple or microsoft or a number of other sites. a number of companies will handle the process for you. one example is twilio but there are others. what matters is that you can do something about your password dilemma while not having an undue impact on your staff or your budget. your path to compliance will be easier because you've provided greater access security, and you might even ease your staff load by adopting policies that work, while also adding a level of security. for you and your it team, it's a win on all sides.           next article    more inside pcmag.com google's stance on sexual harassment is facing questions china: to avoid spying, trump should swap iphone

     pcmag asia     mobile                    how the honor play is perfect for gaming  by         pcmag uk   sept. 7, 2018, 9:52 a.m.  giving power-hungry games something to chew on  paid promotion      mobile gaming is gathering momentum with each passing month. already this year we've seen games that found their feet on pc and consoles landing on android phones. fortnite and playerunknown's battlegrounds are two massively-popular examples of this. so we all want loads of power in our mobile devices, but we also want affordable phones that don't require a month's salary to buy. enter the honor play, a phone with a dizzying amount of gaming grunt that won't break the bank. it's all about the cpu and gpu the kirin 970 chipset that powers the honor play is the first important factor in providing the best gaming performance. it also has some nifty ai features, but we'll come to that a little later. built using a 10nm process, the kirin 970 has a total of eight cores. these are split so that four cores run at 2.36ghz and four at 1.8ghz. the lower speed cores are great for getting the best out of battery life, and run the majority of the phone's features day-to-day. the higher clock-speed cores are then utilized when the phone needs more power. it's this extra grunt that forms the basis of the honor play's gaming chops. gpu turbo is the key to making sure that the phone is optimised for gaming performance. it's able to reduce power consumption by 30 per cent while still delivering a 60 per cent improvement to performance. this power efficiency is crucial, meaning you have to top up the battery less. that saves time and inconvenience but also helps keep your battery running well for longer. the good news is when you do need to charge the phone you'll be waiting a lot less time. usb-c offers much faster charging on the honor play, plus the reversible connector is much less hassle than previous usb connectors. oh, and you get a dedicated headphone jack too, so you can play and charge at the same time.  how does ai help? optimisation is an important factor in gaming. that might be writing the game in such a way as to use specific cpu or gpu features that allow your phone to save power and provide the best performance. the advanced ai features of the kirin 970 are also key to this. while playing a game the processor is able to monitor what's on screen. it uses this information to provide optimisations that will save power and increase performance. gamers will understand this improves the framerate - known as fps, or frames per second - and keep it stable. a good base framerate is important, of course, and the higher the better in almost all games. but a framerate that jumps around is a stuttery frustrating experience, which is why the kirin 970 is so important.  a new dimension in gaming not only does the honor play offer a powerful phone to give you a great experience every day, it also offers a fourth dimension! using haptic feedback, the phone delivers vibrations while you play. this gives you a great sense of involvement in the game. you'll feel the explosions or sense the sniper rifle clicking as you prepare to take down the enemy. that works together with the honor play's amazing screen and powerful sound to deliver a great gaming experience, and it does all of this for a fraction of the price of other phones. mobilehonor play

79.99   prossleek and sturdy design with great sound reproduction and is very lightweight.consbass is muddy, is not usb type-c compatible, untextured buttons make for some awkward fiddling when adjusting volume.bottom linea very good pair of earphones for any occasion and is very comfortable for workout sessions.  aug. 24, 2018   samuel h. tong       the plantronics backbeat fit 305 earphones are crafted for those who prefer their music on the go, and perfect for those who are looking to ditch the wires for a more convenient, wireless life. i spent a good few weeks with these earbuds, plugging them in whenever i get the chance to and i must admit that my expectations were more than fulfilled. what's in the box? the earphones are packed nicely and securely alongside a handful of unhelpful manuals, two sets of different sized eartips and a short micro-usb cable.  design & build quality the fit 305 design is sleek, simple, and minimal which is not a bad thing. i wasn\u2019t particularly a fan of the different coloured finishings above the control hubs but i grew to like it, and it\u2019s what makes the fit 305\u2019s design so unique, where other earphone maker tends to sway closer to the 2 colour scheme, plantronics isn\u2019t afraid to shake the design up a little. the control hub is right where it should be. just slightly below the ear and just above the neck, easily accessible. my only complaint that i have with these are the untextured buttons, i wished that plantronics could\u2019ve implemented three-way textured buttons to easily distinguish between the volume up, centre, and volume down buttons so i don\u2019t have to awkwardly fiddle around the control hub to get to where i want. it would\u2019ve also been nice to have magnetic earbuds to keep them in place when it\u2019s idle around my neck, thought that's more of a minor nitpick. where the design falls short, the build quality doesn\u2019t. the wires are nylon braided which makes them almost impossible to tangle and extremely rugged. i never have to worry about chucking it into my gym bag after an adrenaline driven workout. the fit 305 is also protected with an ipx5 rating which means it\u2019s safe against sweat and water, though it is not swimming-friendly and prone to attracting dust. sound quality plantronics is no stranger in the audio department and this is definitely reflected in the fit 305, their history goes back all the way to nasa\u2019s apollo programme, even neil armstrong used one. their history alone should tell you that when it comes to audio, plantronics brings their a-game. from the strumming of a guitar to the banging of the drums, the earphones deliver an excellent experience on the high frequencies. vocals sound crisp and clear over on the mid frequency but it is at the lows where the fit 305 falls short. the bass on these sound muddy and it\u2019s disappointing that the earphones are marketed as a sporty accessory but doesn\u2019t sound like one. it\u2019s not that big of a deal for me but i can see how it\u2019ll be a problem for others.  weight and comfort the earpieces have a wingtip design making it easy to secure in your ears while also being comfortable. the extra earpieces should allow room for more options to those with different sized earlobes. the earphones are extremely lightweight, weighing in at only 14 grams and on many occasions i find myself lost in my music, not even realizing i\u2019m wearing them. battery life the battery life on the fit 305 is nothing short of amazing. most of my sessions lasts just shy of 6 hours which is expected from its advertised 6 hours of playback time. plantronics also packed in a \u201cdeepsleep mode\u201d that allow users to keep the earphones turned off for up to 6 months and still maintain its charge. it takes about an hour and a half to get it fully charged through a micro-usb cable. in an era where the type-c is being pushed forward, i wish that plantronics had hopped onto the bandwagon as well. connectivity the fit 305 comes with bluetooth 4.1 meaning it is capable of connecting to 2 devices simultaneously. it makes switching from listening to music on your phone, to watching a movie on your laptop a breeze. connectivity range isn\u2019t the best at only 10 meters so don\u2019t expect to do a 100 meters sprint without your phone in your pocket. conclusion at the end of the day, i would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a pair of wireless earphones to pick up the fit 305 for its great design, excellent sound reproduction, and great battery life. it may be a bit of a stretch for your wallet at an msrp of usd $79 (rm 325) but placing your cash on a plantronics hardware is not a bad deal.

(here's how to see if cambridge has your data.) facebook was shocked (shocked!) that this all happened. but major tech companies make a lot of money off your info, either by mining it to sell you stuff or by selling it outright to others. the social network isn't going to change how it does business exactly. facebook does allow you to put some rather robust account restrictions in place. however, its tools can be hard to decipher, even if they're getting easier to find (see below). implementing some of them may limit what you can do with facebook; short of deleting your facebook account, it should provide you with some peace of mind. editor's note: this story was updated on april 19 with details about facebook's updated settings.this article originally appeared on pcmag.com.        1protecting your information at your first login to facebook sometime on or after april 19, 2018, you'll see this new greeting. it's facebook's way of saying \"yeah, we got in trouble, now we're going to pointedly tell you that you can make adjustments to your privacy settings so we don't get in trouble again.\"this is all about getting you to opt-out of using facebook logins and sharing with other apps and websites; it's not about facebook taking care of the problem, then letting you opt back in to share only what you want. but you can force that issue with some of the steps below.        2visit apps and websites settings: active tab the link on your news feed takes you to the apps and websites section of facebook's settings, which used to be called only apps. you can also get there directly by clicking app settings, or navigate to settings > apps and websites. on a smartphone, go to the hamburger menu () and under settings, select apps > logged in with facebook.the initial tab on the apps and websites page is called active, because it shows all the \"most recent\" (ahem) sites and apps you've logged into using facebook. (recent is a misnomer\u2014i saw listings on my page for sites and apps that have been dead for a few months.) click the checkbox next to any entry you don't actively recognize, then hit the remove button to nix them.        3what were you sharing? if you're curious about what you're sharing with a specific app or website, click the view and edit link for each entry.a pop-up window will display the information each app is accessing; here, you can change those settings if you'd like to keep it installed but restrict the information to which it has access\u2014tell apps you don't want to share your friends list, timeline posts, status updates, events, etc.facebook has removed the option to just prevent sharing those things across the board\u2014they have to be done app by app and site by site.        4what happens when you remove apps sites when you do remove an app or website you'd logged into via facebook, you'll get this warning. doing so may delete your account at the third-party site, and/or any and all activity on the site, even if the account stays intact. you can click an extra box to also kill off any posts, videos, or photos the apps/site posted on facebook for you.         5removal confirmation once you've finished, you'll get this weasel-y confirmation screen that makes it look like it may take a while for all the info and connections to be destroyed. (you know, how like it takes a while to get a refund to your credit card, even though it's always instantaneous when you spend money.)        6check the expired tab this is for apps and websites you logged into once upon a time with facebook, but the login has since expired. each shows the last date and time they were accessed using facebook credentials. like in the active tab, you can click the view and edit link for each to see what was shared.facebook annoyingly does not have a \"check all\" option, so you have to click on each one individually if you want to remove them all or at least a majority. my page had well over 99 entries on it, some dating back to 2014. you'll get the same pop-up showing what happens, and same confirmation if you go through with the removal.        7check the removed tab this last tab shows all the apps and websites you've removed in the past from your account. facebook indicates on the page that you may still have access to previously shared info on those apps/sites (but you can't make privacy changes now), and that hey, \"this list may not include all apps and websites you've removed\"! uh... that doesn't seem helpful.click the view details link under each and you'll get info on when you deleted it (on some entries, not all), and info like your user id number with the service behind each app/site. if you want more info, there's a link to the privacy policy of each, if available. a few i clicked went to 404 pages.        8nuke it:   enter the editor if you want to go semi-nuclear and prevent facebook from doing much sharing at all, here's how: on the desktop, while on the apps and websites page of settings, scroll down to the box that says apps, websites, and games. if it says \"turned on,\" click the edit button. a pop-up will appear...         9disable the platform ... where you can click the turn off button. by doing so, facebook will no longer connect to any third-party sites with your facebook data. you won't be able to log into websites or games using facebook (including sites that use facebook for commenting), share with friends between apps, or do any kind of instant personalization. you'll also get kicked out of any apps you've logged into using facebook.if you turn it off, then turn it back on, you'll find you've been logged out of all the apps and websites you'd used. this is a good way to re-start with connecting to just the apps/sites you trust. (after i did so, i had 168 entries in the removed tab!)on mobile, tap the hamburger menu () and navigate to settings and select apps > apps, websites and games and click edit to turn off.        10game and app notifications while you're on the apps and websites page, look at the game and app notifications section. click it to turn them off, and you'll never see another request from friends to join their annoying games, ever. it doesn't really spare you any shared info, but may save some friendships.        11read the full data policy want to see all of facebook's plans for your data? well, you can't look inside mark zuckerberg's head\u2014yet\u2014but you can read the full facebook data policy, which was also updated today.          related galleries how to create voice memos on your

your data traveling via wi-fi that you've stopped worrying about the safety and security of that data\u2014and about who else might be spying on it, or even stealing it for nefarious purposes? if so, you are\u2014sadly\u2014in the vast majority, and you ought to consider using a viritual private network, or vpn. in fact, when pcmag ran a survey on vpn usage, we found that a shocking 71 percent of the 1,000 respondents had never even used a vpn. even among those who support net neutrality\u2014who you might think would tend to be well informed on technology and privacy issues\u201455 percent had never used a vpn. that attitude to the safety and privacy of personal data creates an enormous risk when it comes to online security. public wi-fi networks, which are ubiquitous and convenient, are unfortunately also highly convenient for attackers looking to compromise your personal information. how do you know, for example, that \"starbucks_wifi_real\" is actually the wi-fi network for the coffee shop? anyone could have created that network, and they may have done so in order to lure victims into disclosing personal information over it. in fact, a popular security researcher prank is to create a network with the same name as a free, popular service and see how many devices will automatically connect because it appears safe. even if you're inclined to trust your fellow humans (which i do not recommend), you still shouldn't trust your internet service provider. in its infinite wisdom, congress has decided that your isp is allowed to sell your browsing history. in short, it's time to start thinking about protecting your personal information. that's where virtual private networks, or vpns, come in. these services use simple software to protect your internet connection, and they give you greater control over how you appear online, too. while you might never have heard of vpn services, they are valuable tools that you should understand and use. so who needs a vpn? the short answer is that everyone does. even mac users can benefit from a vpn. what is a vpn? in the simplest terms, a vpn creates a secure, encrypted connection\u2014which can be thought of as a tunnel\u2014between your computer and a server operated by the vpn service. in a professional setting, this tunnel effectively makes you part of the company's network, as if you were physically sitting in the office. while you're connected to a vpn, all your network traffic passes through this protected tunnel, and no one\u2014not even your isp\u2014can see your traffic until it exits the tunnel from the vpn server and enters the public internet. if you make sure to only connect to websites secured with https, your data will continue to be encrypted even after it leaves the vpn. think about it this way: if your car pulls out of your driveway, someone can follow you and see where you are going, how long you are at your destination, and when you are coming back. they might even be able to peek inside your car and learn more about you. with a vpn service, you are essentially driving into a closed parking garage, switching to a different car, and driving out, so that no one who was originally following you knows where you went.    vpn services, while tremendously helpful, are not foolproof. there's no magic bullet (or magic armor) when it comes to security. a determined adversary can almost always breach your defenses in one way or another. using a vpn can't help if you unwisely download ransomware on a visit to the dark web, or if you foolishly give up your data to a phishing attack. what a vpn can do is to protect you against mass data collection and the casual criminal vacuuming up user data for later use. it can also protect your privacy by making it harder for advertisers to figure out who and where you are. that's why vpns are important, even when you're browsing from the comfort and (relative) safety of your home. who needs a vpn? first and foremost, using a vpn prevents anyone on the same network access point (or anywhere else) from intercepting your web traffic in a man-in-the-middle attack. this is especially handy for travelers and for those using public wi-fi networks, such as web surfers at hotels, airports, and coffee shops. someone on the same network, or the person in control of the network you're using, could conceivably intercept your information while you're connected. vpns also cloak your computer's actual ip address, hiding it behind the ip address of the vpn server you're connected to. ip addresses are distributed based on location, so you can estimate someone's location simply by looking at their ip address. and while ip addresses may change, it's possible to track someone across the internet by watching where the same ip address appears. using a vpn makes it harder for advertisers (or spies, or hackers) to track you online. many vpn services also provide their own dns resolution system. think of dns as a phone book that turns a text-based url like \"pcmag.com\" into a numeric ip address that computers can understand. savvy snoops can monitor dns requests and track your movements online. greedy attackers can also use dns poisoning to direct you to bogus phishing pages designed to steal your data. when you use a vpn's dns system, it's another layer of protection. vpns are necessary for improving individual privacy, but there are also people for whom a vpn is essential for personal and professional safety. some journalists and political activists rely on vpn services to circumvent government censorship and safely communicate with the outside world. check the local laws before using a vpn in china, russia, turkey, or any country with with repressive internet policies. what about using a vpn for bittorrent? some services, such as torguard and nordvpn, allow peer-to-peer file sharing and the use of bittorrent sharing. others restrict such activity to specific servers. be smart: learn the company's terms of service\u2014and the local laws on the subject. that way you can't complain if you run into trouble. it is also possible (emphasis on \"possible\") that vpns may be able to save net neutrality repeal. kind of. for those who are unaware, net neutrality is the much-discussed concept that isps treat web services and apps equally, and not create fast lanes for companies that pay more, or require consumers to sign up for specific plans in order to access services like netflix or twitter. depending on how isps respond to a newly deregulated environment, a vpn could tunnel traffic past any choke points or blockades thrown up by isps. that said, an obvious response would be to block or throttle all vpn traffic. we'll have to see how this plays out. how to choose a vpn service the vpn services market has exploded in the past few years, and a small competition has turned into an all-out melee. many providers are capitalizing on the general population's growing concerns about surveillance and cybercrime, which means it's getting hard to tell when a company is actually providing a secure service and when it's throwing out a lot of fancy words while selling snake oil. in fact, since vpn services have become so popular in the wake of congress killing isp privacy rules, there have even been fake vpns popping up, so be careful. it's important to keep a few things in mind when evaluating which vpn service is right for you: reputation, performance, type of encryption used, transparency, ease of use, support, and extra features. don't just focus on price or speed, though those are important factors. in fact, not all vpn services require that you pay. several services we've listed here also have free vpn offerings. you tend to get what you pay for, as far as features and server locations go, but if your needs are basic, a free service can still keep you safe. tunnelbear and protonvpn, for example, offer limited but serviceable free vpns. some vpn services provide a free trial, so take advantage of it. make sure you are happy with what you signed up for, and take advantage of money-back guarantees if you're not. this is actually why we also recommend starting out with a short-term subscription\u2014a week or a month\u2014to really make sure you are happy. keepsolid vpn unlimited offers a one-week vacation subscription, for example. yes, you may get a discount by signing up for a year, but that's more money at stake should you realize the service doesn't meet your performance needs. most users want a full graphical user interface for managing their vpn connection and settings, though a few would rather download a configuration file and import it into the openvpn client. most vpn companies we have reviewed support all levels of technological savvy, and the best have robust customer support for when things go sideways. can you trust your vpn service? if you're using a service to route all your internet traffic through its servers, you have to be able to trust the provider. established security companies, such as f-secure, may have only recently come to the vpn market. it's easier to trust companies that have been around a little longer, simply because their reputation is likely to be known. but companies and products can change quickly. today's slow vpn service that won't let you cancel your subscription could be tomorrow's poster child for excellence. we're not cryptography experts, so we can't verify all of the encryption claims providers make. instead, we focus on the features provided. bonus features like ad blocking, firewalls, and kill switches that disconnect you from the web if your vpn connection drops, go a long way toward keeping you safe. we also prefer providers that support openvpn, since it's a standard that's known for its speed and reliability. it's also, as the name implies, open source, meaning it benefits from many developers' eyes looking for potential problems. since we last tested vpns, we've given special attention to the privacy practices of vpn companies and not just the technology they provide. in our testing, we read through the privacy policies and discuss company practices with vpn service representatives. what we look for is a commitment to protect user information, and to take a hands-off approach to gathering user data. as part of our research, we also make sure to find out where the company is based and under what legal framework it operates. some countries don't have data-retention laws, making it easier to keep a promise of \"we don't keep any logs.\" it's also useful to know under what circumstances a vpn company will hand over information to law enforcement and what information it would have to provide if that should happen. the best vpn services have a privacy policy that clearly spells out what the service does, what information it collects, and what it does to protect that information. some companies explain that they collect some information, but don't inform you about how they intend to use that information. others are more transparent. while a vpn can protect your privacy online, you might still want to take the additional step of avoiding paying for one using a credit card, for moral or security reasons. several vpn services now accept anonymous payment methods such bitcoin, and some even accept retailer gift cards. both of these transactions is about as close as you can get to paying with cash for something online. that starbucks gift card may be better spent on secure web browsing than a mediocre-at-best latte. understanding the limitations of a vpn vpns are great, but it's just as important to know what a vpn can and cannot do. a tool is only useful when it's used correctly, after all. while it hides your ip address, a vpn is not a true anonymization service. for that, you'll want to access the tor network, which will almost certainly slow down your connection. while a vpn tunnels your web traffic to a vpn server, tor bounces around your traffic through several volunteer nodes making it much, much harder to track. using tor also grants access to hidden dark web sites, which a vpn simply cannot do. that said, some services, such as nordvpn, offer tor access on specific servers. ivpn offers a similar feature called multi-hop vpn, which lets you route your web traffic in tricky ways. using a vpn will prevent most kinds of dns attacks that would redirect you to a phishing page, but a regular old page made to look like a legit one in order to trick you into entering your data can still work. some vpns, and most browsers, are pretty good about blocking phishing pages, but this attack still claims too many victims to be ignored. use common sense and be sure to verify that websites are what they say they are by looking carefully at the url and always visiting https sites. in addition to blocking malicious sites and ads, some vpns also claim to block malware. we don't test the efficacy of these network-based protections, but most appear to be blacklists of sites known to host malicious software. that's great, but don't assume it's anywhere near as good as standalone antivirus. use this feature to complement, not replace, your antivirus. lastly, keep in mind that some security conscious companies like banks may be confused by your vpn. if your bank sees you logging in from what appears to be another us state or even another country, it can raise red flags. expect to see captchas and more frequent multifactor requests when your vpn is on. vpns by the numbers some important things to look for when shopping for a vpn are the number of licenses for simultaneous connections that come with your fee, the number of servers available, and the number of locations in which the company has servers. it all comes down to numbers. most vpn services allow you to connect up to five devices with a single account. any service that offers fewer connections is outside the mainstream. keep in mind that you'll need to connect every device in your home individually to the vpn service, so just two or three licenses won't be enough for the average nested pair. note that many vpn services offer native apps for both android and ios, but that such devices count toward your total number of connections. of course, there are more than just phones and computers in a home. game systems, tablets, and smart home devices such as light bulbs and fridges all need to connect to the internet. many of these things can't run vpn software on their own, nor can they be configured to connect to a vpn through their individual settings. in these cases, you may be better off configuring your router to connect with the vpn of your choice. by adding vpn protection to your router, you secure the traffic of every gadget connected to that router. and the router\u2014and everything protected by it\u2014uses just one of your licenses. nearly all of the companies we have reviewed offer software for most consumer routers and even routers with preinstalled vpn software, making it even easier to add this level of protection. when it comes to servers, more is always better. more servers mean that you're less likely to be shunted into a vpn server that is already filled to the brim with other users. nordvpn, private internet access, and torguard currently lead the pack with well over 3,000 servers each\u2014nordvpn is at the forefront with 4,875 servers. but the competition is beginning to heat up. last year, only a handful of companies offered more than 500 servers, now it's becoming unusual to find a company offering fewer than 1,000 servers. the number and distribution of those servers is also important. the more places a vpn has to offer, the more options you have to spoof your location! more importantly, having numerous servers in diverse locales means that no matter where you go on earth you'll be able to find a nearby vpn server. the closer the vpn server, the better the speed and reliability of the connection it can offer you. remember, you don't need to connect to a far-flung vpn server in order to gain security benefits. for most purposes, a server down the street is as safe as one across the globe. in the most recent round of testing, we've also looked at how many virtual servers a given vpn company uses. a virtual server is just what it sounds like\u2014a software-defined server running on server hardware that might have several virtual servers onboard. the thing about virtual servers is that they can be configured to appear as if they are in one country when they are actually being hosted somewhere else. that's an issue if you're especially concerned about where you web traffic is traveling. it's a bit worrisome to choose one location and discover you're actually connected somewhere else entirely.  see how we test vpns what's the fastest vpn? we have often said that having to choose between security and convenience is a false dichotomy, but it is at least somewhat true in the case of vpn services. when a vpn is active, your web traffic is taking a more circuitous route than usual, often resulting in sluggish download and upload speeds as well as increased latency. the good news is that using a vpn probably isn't going to remind you of the dial-up days of yore. most services provide perfectly adequate internet speed when in use, and can even handle streaming hd video. however, 4k video and other data-intensive tasks like gaming over a vpn are another story. some vpn services, such as nordvpn, have started to roll out specialty servers for high-bandwidth activities. and nearly every service we have tested includes a tool to connect you with the fastest available network. of course, you can always limit your vpn use to when you're not on a trusted network. when we test vpns, we use the ookla speed test tool. (note that ookla is owned by pcmag's publisher, ziff davis.) this test provides metrics for latency, download speeds, and upload speeds. any one of these can be an important measurement depending on your needs, but we tend to view the download speed as the most important. after all, we live in an age of digital consumption. our speed tests stress comparison and reproducibility. that means we stand by our work, but your individual results may vary. after all, perhaps you live on top of a vpn server, or just happen to have a super-high bandwidth connection. what follows are the results from our top-rated vpns as of may, 2018. all that being said, we currently name torguard as the fastest vpn service. it doesn't take the top spot in all of our tests, but has remarkably low latency and had the best performance in the all-important download tests. fittingly, it offers many add-ons such as dedicated ip addresses that, along with its speed, will appeal to the bittorrent users it is designed to protect. can i use a vpn for netflix? borders still exist on the web, in the form of geographic restrictions for streaming content. the bbc iplayer, for example, lets uk residents watch the beeb to their heart's content. the rest of the world, not so much. but if you were to select a vpn server in the uk, your computer's ip address would appear to be the same as the server, allowing you to view the content. the trouble is that netflix and similar video streaming services are getting wise to the scam. in our testing, we found that netflix blocks streaming more often than not when we were using a vpn. there are a few exceptions, but netflix is actively working to protect its content deals. vpns that work with netflix today may not work tomorrow. netflix blocking paying customers might seem odd, but it's all about regions and not people. just because you paid for netflix in one place does not mean you're entitled to the content available on the same service but in a different location. media distribution and rights are messy and complicated. you may or may not agree with the laws and terms of service surrounding media streaming, but you should definitely be aware that they exist and understand when you're taking the risk of breaking them. netflix, for its part, lays out how that it will attempt to verify a user's location in order to provide content in section 6c of its terms of use document. what's the best vpn for kodi? if you don't know what kodi is, you're not alone. however, an analysis of searches leading to our site reveals that a surprising number of you are, in fact looking for vpn that works with the mysterious kodi. dictionary.com defines kodi as a possible misspelling of \"jodi,\" but pcmag analyst ben moore clarified for me that kodi is \"free, open-source software for managing your local collection of movies, television shows, music, and photos.\" with kodi, you can access your media over a local connection (lan) or from a remote media server, if that's your thing. this is, presumably, where concerns about vpn enter the picture. a device using a vpn, for example, will have its connection encrypted on the local network. you might have trouble connecting to it. using chromecast on a vpn device just doesn't work, for example. kodi users might have the same issue. for local vpn issues, you have a couple of options. first, consider installing vpn software on your router and not using a vpn on your local machines. alternatively, many vpn services offer browser plug-ins that only encrypt your browser traffic. that's not ideal from a security perspective, but it's useful when all you need to secure is your browser information. some, but not all, vpn services will let you designate specific applications to be routed outside the encrypted tunnel. this means the traffic will be unencrypted, but also accessible locally. if you're trying to connect to a remote media source with kodi, a vpn would likely play a different role. it might, for example, prevent your isp from determining what you're up to. it might also be useful if you're connecting to a third-party service for kodi that allows streaming of copyright-infringing material. keep in mind, however, that some vpn services specifically forbid the use of their services for copyright infringement. vpn for windows 10 and beyond when we test vpns, we generally start with the windows client. this is often the most complete review, covering several different platforms as well as the service's features and pricing in depth. that's purely out of necessity, since most of our readers use windows (although this writer is currently using a macbook air). we currently use a lenovo thinkpad t460s laptop running the latest version of windows 10. we periodically upgrade to a newer machine, in order to simulate what most users experience. but as you can see from the chart at the top, however, windows is not the only platform for vpns. the android mobile operating system, for example, is the most widely used os on the planet. so it makes sense that we also test vpns for android. that's not to ignore apple users. we also review vpn clients for macos and ios. using a vpn is a little trickier for chromeos users, however. while google has worked to make it easier to use a vpn with a chromebook or chromebox, it's not always a walk in the park. our guide to how to set up a vpn on a chromebook can make the task a bit easier, however. in these cases, you might find it easier to install a vpn plug-in for the chrome browser. this will only secure some of your traffic, but it's better than nothing. finally, we have lately begun to review the best linux vpn apps, too. using a mobile vpn we used to advise people to do banking and other important business over their cellular connection when using a mobile device, since it is generally safer than connecting with a public wi-fi network. but even that isn't always a safe bet. researchers have demonstrated how a portable cell tower, such as a femtocell, can be used for malicious ends. the attack hinges on jamming the lte and 3g bands, which are secured with strong encryption, and forcing devices to connect with a phony tower over the less-secure 2g band. because the attacker controls the fake tower, he can carry out a man-in-the-middle attack and see all the data passing over the cellular connection. admittedly, this is an exotic attack, but it's far from impossible. wi-fi attacks, on the other hand, are probably far more common than we'd like to believe. while attending the black hat convention, researchers saw thousands of devices connecting to a rogue access point. it had been configured to mimic networks that victim's devices had previously connected to, since many devices will automatically reconnect to a known network without checking with the user. that's why we recommend getting a vpn app for your mobile device to protect all your mobile communications. even if you don't have it on all the time, using a mobile vpn is a smart way to protect your personal information. most vpn services offer both android and ios vpn apps, saving you the trouble of configuring your phone's vpn settings yourself. vpn providers typically allow up to five devices to be connected simultaneously under a single account. also, while there are free vpn services available, many require that mobile users sign up for a paid subscription. not all mobile vpn apps are created equal. in fact, most vpn providers offer different services (and sometimes, different servers) for their mobile offerings than they do for their desktop counterparts. we're pleased to see that nordvpn and private internet access provide the same excellent selection of servers regardless of platform. these apps received an editors' choice nod both for desktop vpn apps and android vpn apps. one feature of note for android users is that some vpn services also block online ads and trackers. while iphone owners can use apps like 1blocker to remove ads and trackers from safari, ad blockers aren't available on the google play store. if you're of the iphone persuasion, there are a few other caveats to consider for a mobile vpn. some iphone vpn apps don't use openvpn, even if the vpn service that made the app supports the protocol. that's because apple requires additional vetting if a company wants to include openvpn with its app. vpn app developers have slowly started jumping through those extra hoops and are bringing support for protocols such as openvpn to ios. thankfully, there's a workaround for this problem. instead of using the vpn app from the company from which you've purchased a subscription, you can download the standalone openvpn app. open it, and you can enter your subscription information from the vpn company you've decided to work with. the openvpn app will then connect to the vpn company's servers using our preferred protocol. which vpn is right for you? computer and software providers work hard to make sure that the devices you buy are safe right out of the box. but they don't provide everything you'll need. antivirus software, for example, consistently outperforms the built-in protections. in the same vein, vpn software lets you use the web and wi-fi with confidence that your information will remain secure. it's critically important and often overlooked. even if you don't use it every moment of every day, a vpn is a fundamental tool that everyone should have at their disposal\u2014like a password manager or an online backup service. a vpn is also a service that will only become more important as our more of our devices become connected. so stay safe, and get a vpn. click through the review links of the best vpn

               turns out, (cyber) crime does pay  by          michael kan       april 24, 2018, 3:11 a.m.  cybercrime is generating at least $1.5 trillion in annual revenue, according to a new study from uk criminology expert michael mcguire.       there's big money to be madee on the dark web; cybercrime is generating at least $1.5 trillion in annual revenue, according to a new study. criminology expert michael mcguire embarked on a nine-month study that focused on a key question: how much do cybercriminals really make? what he found was a shadowy, but organized industry that's been making some people very rich. \"this is not cybercrime as a business,\" mcguire said in a talk at the rsa security conference last friday. \"this is cybercrime as an economy.\" mcguire interviewed 50 convicted or currently active cybercriminals, and spoke with dozens of experts from law enforcement, financial institutions, and it security companies. he estimates that top cybercrime earners are raking in as much as $2 million a year. mid-level earners, on the other hand, will pull in $900,000 on average. low-income miscreants generally make $42,000 a year, but that's still more than recent college graduates in the uk, he said.  what's driving all this revenue? ransomware, data breaches, and cryptocurrency mining have received most of the limelight when it comes to cybercrime. but according to mcguire, the big bucks are being made through the sale of illicit goods online, particularly prescription pharmaceuticals and counterfeit products. these illegal sales\u2014which can be done on dark web market places or on amazon and ebay\u2014can generate $860 billion in annual revenue. next in line was intellectual property theft, which generated $500 billion in revenue. this includes the mundane trade of digital piracy, in addition to underground online forums that sell corporate trade secrets. in contrast, the ransomware market only pulled in $1 billion in annual revenue. the data trading market, which specializes in selling stolen credit cards and social security numbers, generated an estimated $160 billion. mcguire adds that the big earners in the cybercriminal world are usually running the online platforms that sell illegal goods, whether they be drugs or stolen credit cards.  how can any of this be stopped? mcguire pointed to a key cog in the cybercrime economy: money laundering. cybercriminals are routinely trying to translate their illegal profits into actual cash, but stopping this could put a serious dent in their business.  related articles   hackers plead guilty to creating mirai botnet  hackers plead guilty to creating mirai botnet     according to his research, cryptocurrencies are only playing a small role in global money laundering schemes. most cybercriminals prefer to use legitimate payment services like paypal, bitcoin atms, and western union. in some cases, money can also be laundered through internet platforms such as online games, airbnb, and uber. one cybercriminal can pay cash to another by simply opening an account on any of the platforms and pretend to buy a service. \"law enforcement and cybersecurity professional need to get with these platforms and help get their act together,\" he said. mcguire is a senior lecturer at the university of surrey. the security firm bromium sponsored his study.      next article    more inside pcmag.com rockstar strongly recommends red dead redemption 2 launch patch google's stance on sexual harassment is facing questions china: to avoid spying,

out some changes to 'ensure that newer posts are more likely to appear first in feed.'       ever since it switched from a chronological to algorithmic feed in 2016, instagram hasn't always felt very \"instant.\" like when you open the app and see a bunch of posts from days ago atop your feed, with fresh content buried below. fortunately, instagram is now going back to its roots a bit. don't get too excited: instagram isn't switching back to a chronological feed\u2014but the facebook-owned company on thursday announced that, based on user feedback, it will roll out some changes to \"ensure that newer posts are more likely to appear first in feed.\" \"with these changes, your feed will feel more fresh, and you won't miss the moments you care about,\" instagram wrote. \"so if your best friend shares a selfie from her vacation in australia, it will be waiting for you when you wake up.\"  related articles   3 ways to stop hating instagram  3 ways to stop hating instagram     meanwhile, instagram is also testing a \"new posts\" button that will let you manually refresh your feed when you're ready. \"we've heard it can feel unexpected when your feed refreshes and automatically bumps you to the top,\" instagram explained. the new posts button \"lets you choose when you want to refresh, rather than it happening automatically.\" until you tap that button, you'll stay right where you are in your feed. instagram also this week announced that you can now add working links to hashtags and other accounts in your bio. to try it out, hit the edit profile button, go to the bio section, and start typing what want to link, starting with the # symbol for a hashtag or @ for a profile.      next article    more inside pcmag.com rockstar strongly recommends red dead

robots might one day perform surgery in space  by          s.c. stuart      april 21, 2018, 8 p.m.  ucla's dr. jacob rosen discusses his exo-ul8 exoskeleton and raven, a teleoperation system that could one day facilitate surgery for sick or injured space travelers.       i'm inside ucla's bionics lab and yang shen, a graduate student in the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering, is adjusting my upper limbs into exo-ul8, an exoskeleton. once all the straps are tied, he asks if i'm ready. i nod and tense my muscles. they engage with the wearable robotic system so i can go through therapy designed for patients recovering from a stroke. i move one of my hands into the indicated position on the screen in front of me, followed by the other one. the exoskeleton applies force to assist me with the task. the system is the brainchild of dr. jacob rosen, director of the bionics lab and professor of medical robotics in the department. we sat down after the test to discuss how this exoskeleton\u2014and raven, his other robotic systems\u2014are transforming the worlds of medicine, and beyond. here are edited and condensed excerpts from our conversation.  firstly, tell us the background of your research.  my research efforts are focused on medical robotics, and in particular, robotic systems and applications in rehabilitation medicine surgery. there are not enough professional healthcare providers to support an increasing demand for high-quality services for an aging population with an extended life span. automation, as well as robotics, will play a major role. how is your exoskeleton system part of this? there are potentially two roles for the exoskeleton system which you tried today. the first is to use it as an assistive device that one wears all day, which, without them, one cannot function. the second role is to use it as a rehabilitation device, in a clinical setting aiming to recover lost function\u2014either motor control due to neuromuscular trauma, or function and mobility due to trauma to the joints. our primary research effort, with the upper limb exoskeleton at the bionics lab, is part of a collaborative effort with the ronald reagan medical center here at ucla, and focused on recovering motor function following a stroke.  there's also a neuroscience component to it, right? yes, there's a secondary effort to understand the neuroplasticity mechanisms of the brain\u2014a process by which the brain establishes new neural connections lost due to trauma, and recovers lost sensory, motor, or cognitive functions. how is your exoskeleton different from  other forms of tech-based therapies we've seen being trialed now or other exoskeleton systems? i've led the development of four generations of upper limb exoskeletons systems in my academic career\u2014most recently here at ucla. the exo-ul8 is one of the most advanced upper-limb exoskeleton systems of its kind, and includes two single dof (degrees of freedom) hands enabling power grasping. let's talk about  raven, your other medical robotics  venture. i was involved in developing algorithms that can objectively assess surgical skill using data collected from instrumented surgical tools. through our modeling approach, we show that surgery has the same components as \"human language,\" with noticeable signatures of movement which are skill dependent. this quantitative knowledge of surgery provided us a profound insight into the requirements that we need to meet for developing a surgical robot. the core of the raven system architecture is teleoperation, which allows a physical separation between the surgeon, along with the surgical cockpit, and the surgical arms themselves. the distance may be few meters where both the surgeon and the surgical robotic arms are in the same operating room. or across the globe, where thousands of kilometers separate the two. and, importantly, raven, is open source.  we realized that the only way to promote our own research ideas in surgical robotics, as well as to provide a stable research platform to other research groups, was to develop an open-source surgical robotics system. this was the primary incentive for developing raven and its accompanied surgical cockpit. we spun off applied dexterity inc. to sell raven as a research platform for non-human use, and there are currently 18 raven systems operational across the world. but these are primarily used in research still, is that correct? the research we are doing now is at least a decade out from what is being used in hospitals today in a clinical setting. medicine is a very conservative field for a good reason\u2014human life is at stake. obtaining an fda approval for using a surgical robot such as raven with human subjects would require an investment of about $100 million. however, the beauty of algorithms is that they are independent of the hardware involved. once a successful algorithm is developed for automating a surgical task, it can be adopted by any surgical robotic platform. raven made a fictional appearance in space in ender's game. is that one of the potential use cases irl? extreme environments, such as military battlefields, as well as deep space, are testing grounds for these technologies. in these environments, humans may be injured, and their life is at risk, but the medical and surgical expertise is likely to be thousand of kilometers away. all of our studies indicate that there are no technological barriers to deliver high-quality healthcare in places that they don't yet exist, in extreme environments.  related articles   why this engineer is creating 'human-centered' robots  why this engineer is creating 'human-centered' robots     will your system go out into space? it's likely that when astronauts are sent on deep space missions, a robotic system will fly with them. even if one of the astronauts is also a surgeon, it is unlikely that he/she will be proficient in all surgical procedures, so surgical robotic arms will be a critical component aboard the spaceship. the system will also have ai embedded within it, because there's no way to tele-operate at that distance from earth due to communication time delays. can you get specific about any nasa-related projects? at applied dexterity inc. we've just completed a phase one nasa-funded research project which will allow nasa scientists, located in any one of the nasa centers on earth, to teleoperate a raven surgical robot system on board the iss. dr. jacob rosen will be speaking at

   guide    10 must-have android apps for 2018  by max eddy   march 14, 2018  among the million-plus apps in google play are these 10 essentials you simply cannot do without.                         max eddy      whether you're brand new to android or a longtime enthusiast, the google play store's catalog of 3.5 million apps can be intimidating. our list is a great place to begin for anyone looking to jump-start their collection. read about our selection process below, or if you're really eager to download these essentials, go ahead and skip down to the list itself. what's here we openly admit that this list doesn't even begin to approach the seemingly infinite variety of apps on the google play store. we also know that everyone has different priorities when it comes to their android device, so we encourage you to fine-tune it to suit your needs. for example, evernote is an enormously versatile tool, but it might not meet your needs for to-do lists, in which case, you should move to a refined organizational app like  any.do. or maybe after reading lots of comics in comixology, you're curious to read the massive backlog of marvel titles available for a single monthly fee via marvel unlimited. that said, this collection of apps takes care of just about every need. how we choose android apps we test tons of different android apps over the course of the year and many of us here at pcmag use an android phone as our day-to-day device, so we are no strangers to the app landscape. when compiling this list, our first choices go to those that are necessary to get work done, such as google drive and lastpass. the former lets you access files and retrieve important items off your phone with ease, while the latter stores all the passwords you need to gain access to critical apps and services. next, we think about what kinds of apps are popular and how we can fill those categories. everyone takes photos with their phones nowadays, so snapseed, an excellent photo-editing app, makes the list, as well. people also stream all sorts of content to their devices. while there are many options for watching movies and tv on android, netflix takes the honor with its exciting range of content and offline viewing capabilities. in the music-streaming space, spotify offers a near-peerless experience, and it's a great mobile fitness app, too, smartly integrating features like beat-matching to keep runners on pace. another one of our picks hails from the oft-ignored mobile device security category. with the ever-increasing chance of a malicious attack over an unsecured network, a mobile virtual private network  (vpn), like nordvpn, is now a must-have for everyone. what's not here first, there are no games. we hear you moan, but android games deserve their own roundup. there are simply too many of too great a variety. if you want games (and we know you do), you should read our guide to the best android games. that'll take care of all your thumb-twiddling, screen-swiping needs. second, there are only a few google apps on here. it's really easy to just default to them since many are, well, default on android devices. regarding the google apps that did make the list, we've carefully balanced their utility against that of competitors in the space to make sure they really are the best. for example, google drive, an excellent mobile office suite, also gives access to google docs, sheets, and slides. this is just the tip of the android iceberg. there are many more excellent apps in our roundup of the 100 best android apps. do you have different suggestions about the 10 most critical android apps for everything from entertainment to information to productivity and more? let us know in the comments. we update this list periodically and your suggestion might make it into the next update.      comixology comics   freegetting to the few remaining comic book stores in america is a huge hassle, as is storing all of your bagged-and-boarded treasures. comics, the excellent app from digital comics groundbreaker comixology, is the solution to serving both as a storefront and long box. you can browse the seemingly endless lists of titles and then buy new books with a tap. it's wonderfully easy! depending on the state of your wallet, it may even be a bit too easy. the comixology unlimited feature gives all-you-can-read access for $5.99 a month if you're keen for a taster's menu of comics.      evernote   free, plans begin at $34.99 per monthevernote is your list keeper, note taker, voice recorder, to-do manager, webpage clipper, and all-around digital multi-tool. it's overwhelming at first, but you'll quickly find a vast number of ways to put it to good use. our favorite feature is optical character recognition (ocr), which makes text in photos searchable. next time someone hands you a business card, just snap a picture, and evernote will capture all the critical information and make it searchable from all of your devices and computers and accessible on the web. be sure to read our organization expert jill duffy's 5 tips for evernote users.      facebook messenger   freethe trouble with most messaging platforms is that they require you to enlist your friends to join, too. not so with facebook messenger, because most of the living (and even the recently deceased) population already has a facebook account. facebook messenger is loaded with bells and whistles, notably a huge library of stickers, video and voice calling, sms messaging, and even the option to send payments to friends. it's also surprisingly privacy-conscious; you don't need an account to use the app, entering a phone number is optional, and you can send secret messages that use end-to-end encryption so neither the fbi nor facebook can read them.      google drive   free, with additional costs for increased storagegoogle drive isn't just a cloud storage service. in addition to syncing and storing your files, it also includes a powerful mobile office suite, so you can create and edit files from your phone. drive can even store your files locally, for offline viewing and editing. it might not replace your desktop office utilities, but it comes surprisingly close. it also makes it easy to collaborate on and share documents with other people, regardless of platform.      lastpass   freehumans are bad at creating passwords, and we're bad at remembering things. thankfully, there are password managers like lastpass. a password manager generates a unique, complex password for each site or app that requires one. when you need to log in, lastpass fills in the correct information for you. lastpass also securely stores your personal information so you can quickly fill out those tedious forms when you're signing up for a service. it includes a way to safely share passwords with other people, even after you've departed this mortal realm. a new pricing structure lets you create an account and sync passwords between all your devices\u2014mobile or otherwise\u2014for free.      netflix   free, plans begin at $7.99 per monthwhen it comes to mobile video streaming, netflix is hard to beat. it boasts a massive (if unstable) library of tv shows and movies and top-notch features like offline viewing and 4k streaming. netflix is also leading the way among streaming services by producing critically acclaimed original programming like luke cage, the crown, narcos, the oa, and stranger things, to name a few. it even offers a decent selection of streaming anime titles. netflix is no longer just about killing time; it's about keeping up with the conversation about the latest hit shows.     nordvpn   free, plans begin at $3.29 per month %displayprice% at %seller% google and mobile antivirus companies have done a great job of keeping android (mostly) free of dangerous malware. but when you connect to a public wi-fi network, it's possible that nefarious individuals could be intercepting all of your information. that's why virtual private networks are so important, and nordvpn is among the best. other fun tricks you can do with a vpn? hiding your ip address from advertisers and accessing region-locked content.      pocket casts   $3.99podcasts are a great way to catch up with the news, learn more about a certain topic, or listen to entertaining stories. the sleek and highly customizable pocket casts is the perfect companion for chilling out with an episode of your favorite show. the app can also sync your audio across different devices, so that you can pick up where you left off. it's never a bad time to get hooked on a podcast.      snapseed   freegoogle-owned snapseed straddles the line between full-fledged image editor and filter app, all in a sleek and attractive package. best of all is the amount of control it gives you over how filters and effects are applied to your images. it even lets you make nondestructive edits to raw files and fine-tuned adjustments to exposure and detail levels. for creative mobile photographers, it's an excellent option.      spotify   free with paid, ad-free plansthere are many ways to listen to music on your phone, whether it's from google play music or the human-curated slacker radio. spotify, however, offers a winning combination of clear, crisp audio and a massive catalog spanning tons of genres. collaborative playlists let you and your friends enjoy custom mixes, and runners will love the integrated beat-matching workout settings. its multidevice support is impressive, too, letting you switch playback from one device to another remotely. if you only plan to use one streaming music service  on your android device, spotify is the one to choose.          more inside pcmag.com top instagram tips for the

oh/rv001 gaming chair review                         will greenwald      take a seat, grab a joystick whether you play pc games on a monitor or console games on a tv, you need a place to sit. you can use anything from a sofa, to a la-z-boy, to a dining room chair, but if you really want to sit in style while you play, you should get a dedicated gaming chair. they're comfortable, sturdy, and designed with gamers in mind. what makes a chair a gaming chair? at first glance, gaming chairs don't look all that different from desk chairs. they're typically pretty large, with backrests that extend high enough to support your head, along with large armrests and a swiveling base with wheeled castors that let you roll and spin freely. you've probably seen \"executive\" office chairs that look pretty similar. gaming chairs have a few key differences, though. first, the color and style options of gaming chairs are generally very different from office chairs. most office chairs focus on dark colors and earth tones, and have more traditional seat designs. gaming chairs usually come in a variety of colors, and even if the chair is mostly black, there will likely be plenrty of eye-catching accents to make it stand out. the seats of gaming chairs are also designed more closely after racing chairs used in simulators, so you're going to see a lot more bucket seats than frumpy armchair designs. second, gaming chairs are much more adjustable. all of the models we've tested have the usual options like height and tilt, just like office chairs. but they go a step further with adjustable armrests you can pivot, slide, and move up and down. sadly, we've yet to find any with cupholders. third, gaming chairs recline. while office chairs generally offer only limited adjustments on the angle between the seat and the back of the chair, gaming chairs let you lean back with the pull of a lever. every gaming chair we've tested has a reclining function that lets you sit back comfortably and stare at your tv as easily as you can lean forward and watch your computer monitor. all of these features add up to a sturdier, more comfortable chair you can easily use in a variety of situations. it also adds up to a hefty price tag: gaming chairs typically range between $200 and $600, making them several times more expensive than a basic desk chair you can get at an office supply store. of course, if you're going to spend a lot of time in it, you probably want to invest in a good one. they're like beds that way. sizing up the competition the most important thing to consider when shopping for a gaming chair is size. gamers vary wildly in body types, and most manufacturers make chairs specifically designed different sizes. standard gaming chairs usually support a maximum of 240 to 300 pounds, depending on the model. larger, more heavy-duty chairs support maximum weights of 350, 400, and even 450 pounds. the difference in seat dimensions can vary by several inches in width and depth, which can lead to an uncomfortable chair if you buy one that's too big or small. fortunately, most manufacturers offer detailed measurements for every aspect of their chairs. seat depth and width, backrest height and width, armrest height range, and other measurements can all affect how a chair will feel to you. if you aren't sure about a given model, go over the measurements and compare them with your current chair. materials matter the materials of the chair are also important to consider\u2014both what's packed inside and what's wrapped around it. most of the gaming chairs we've seen use polyurethane leather (pu), a leather-like synthetic material, for the covering, and dense foam for the padding. it's the most common configuration for a gaming chair, but it isn't the only option. some chairs have fabric shells, while others are available in genuine leather (for significantly more money). the chairs on this list all use similar foam padding, but the amount and placement of the padding can vary. the seat will almost always be solid, as it should be to support your weight, but the chair back is a different story. the akracing and dxracer chairs we've tested heavily pad the skeleton of the back of the chair, but otherwise use a thinner layer of padding and the tension of the pu leather to provide more give with less mass. meanwhile, the secretlab titan completely packs its chair back with foam. this affects how dense and firm the chair can feel. we're fans of the thick, full-back foam filling. try before you buy (if you can) it's best to try furniture before you buy it, but that isn't always the case for gaming chairs. you can sometimes find a limited selection at your nearby best buy, or better yet a regional computer chain like fry's electronics or micro center. aside from that, your best bet to try these chairs before you buy them is to go to video game conventions like pax, where gaming chair companies often set up booths with chairs to sit in (and tend to have convention-exclusive discounts available). otherwise, check all the details of the chair you want before you buy, because it's a significant investment in a piece of furniture you'll be spending a lot of time in. for more, check out our favorite desktop and laptop pcs for gaming. while you're at it, have a look at some accessories to help improve your game, including headsets, keyboards, and mice.  best gaming chairs featured in this roundup:   secretlab titan gaming chair review  msrp: $399.00  at   pros: sturdy construction with thick pu

mobile devices.consnot as many quality original shows as other services.  mobile apps and web interface sometimes stutter.  limited accessibility options.bottom linestarz offers an expansive movie library and a moderate sampling of original shows, but its app experience doesn't feel as premium or stable as the competition's.  oct. 26, 2018   ben moore       if you enjoy watching tv shows and movies, chances are you already subscribe to two or three video streaming services. starz, which is primarily known as a premium channel along the lines of hbo or cinemax, is another service to consider. starz's large catalog of movies distinguishes it from the pack, but its small library of original content does not compare well to what the best of the competition offers. in testing, we also encountered some reliability issues with its apps and interfaces. consider editors' choices netflix for on-demand content and hulu or sling tv for a cable alternative. what can i watch with starz? you should choose video streaming services that offer programs you enjoy watching. for instance, some people prefer live news and sports programming. others may only want to watch the latest trending shows on their own schedule. still, others may want a bit of both. starz offers a mix of original shows and on-demand movies and is most similar to hbo now and cbs all access.  view all 5 photos in gallery    starz features all of the premium channel's current and past original programs. episodes from on-air shows go live at the same time as they do on cable, and you can stream entire series and seasons of past shows on-demand, too. original shows currently available for streaming include america to me, american gods, boss, counterpart, liberty city, outlander, survivor's remorse, and the white queen. this list of original programming is not nearly as extensive as those of netflix, amazon prime, or hbo now, nor does it feature as many well-known titles. a show can still be excellent without being popular, but getting enough exposure to attract people to subscribe will always be an issue. starz also offers a selection of children's and anime programming. some examples include digimon, garfield and friends, ghost in the shell, inu yasha, naruto, madeline, paddington bear, and jim henson's the storyteller. comedy series are also available, among them martin lawrence's 1st amendment stand up, kevin hart's laugh out loud series, new york's funniest, night train with wyatt cenac, and party down.  a major appeal of starz is its extensive movie catalog; after all, prolific film studio lionsgate owns the channel. at the time of this review, starz offers an impressive catalog of 1,263 movies. that's especially noteworthy when you consider that many video streaming services are turning away from this movie-centric model. some examples of movies on the service include 2012, 27 dresses, borat, independence day, juno, jumanji, law abiding citizen, office space, spiderman: homecoming, the proposal, the social network, and zombieland. kid-specific titles include casper, charlotte's web, cloudy with a chance of meatballs, home alone, home alone 2, like mike, rv, surf's up, the karate kid, and up. this is only a small sampling of the available titles; you can check out everything available on the starz website. also note that the movie and tv series lineup may change at times, much as shows arrive and leave on the other video streaming platforms. pricing and platforms starz costs $8.99 per month, which is reasonable for an on-demand streaming service. you can save some money by switching to an annual plan, which costs $74.99 per year. starz's pricing falls right in the middle of other cabled-channel-turned-streaming-service options. for example, cbs all access' base plan is cheaper at $5.99 per month; at the other end of the spectrum, hbo now costs $14.99 per month. starz allows you to stream on up to four devices simultaneously, which compares favorably to most services. unlike the way that hbo splits cable and on-demand subscriptions into hbo go and hbo now, all starz services have the same name: starz. as for subscribing, you can either add starz to an existing cable subscription or purchase it outright. users can also sign up via the mobile app and manage their subscription from there; a free seven-day trial option is available here, though it does require you to enter a payment option and cancel on your own before it expires. starz is available as an add-on to other video streaming services including amazon prime video, directv now, hulu, sling tv, or youtube tv for the same price. the starz streaming service works on a wide range of platforms and streaming media devices, including phones and tablets running at least android 4.1 or ios 8.1. it's also available on android and apple tvs; amazon fire tablets, fire tvs, and fire tv sticks; and roku devices. additionally, you can watch starz on the xbox one and one s; select smart tvs from sony, samsung, and lg; and the chrome, edge, firefox, and safari browsers. starz's web interface starz's web dashboard is functional and looks fine, but it's not as sleek as what some competitors offer. occasionally, this interface also lagged a bit in my testing. across the top, starz displays a list of horizontal menu items: home, featured, series, movies, my list, schedule. the categories work as you expect; each shows various sliders of noteworthy content broken down into categories such as originals, popular, just added, or a specific genre. the my list section organizes everything that you are currently watching, want to watch, or have downloaded in one place. the schedule interface is an easy way to see everything set to air on any of the starz channels. a live tv option for the main starz channel is also available on some platforms.  on the right-hand side of the screen, you can switch profiles, search for content, or access the settings. starz offers a wide range of content across the rating spectrum (including nc-17 and tv-ma), so i appreciate that starz includes parental controls. it's pretty simple to set up as well. just enter a pin and select a maximum rating that each profile is allowed to view for both the tv and movie sections. from the settings menu, you can also view and manage subscription information, access the faqs, or get in contact with starz directly. notably missing, however, are accessibility options, as i discuss a bit later. mobile app i installed starz's android app on nexus 5x running android 8.1 and signed into my account without any issues. the app looks bland and lifeless compared to those of competitors, especially hulu and netflix. it also stutters a bit more often than i would prefer. that said, i do appreciate the dark theme and the occasional light-hearted language in some sections. the app's homepage shows a slider with a few featured shows going across the top. below the slider, users have three selections to choose from: featured, series, and movies. you can swipe from the left to reveal a hidden menu with additional options. here, you get the same options as on the main screen, along with my list. one missing section is the schedule option from the desktop, which means you won't be able to watch the starz channel live on mobile. that said, the vast majority of the titles you see in the schedule are available for streaming anyway.  tap on the settings to access app and account preferences. in addition to managing account and subscription information, you can launch a faq section right from within the app or contact starz directly with a form email. the application preferences area is where you set streaming rules for cellular connections and edit parental control settings for different profiles. back on the home page, clicking on any of the main content categories leads to a more vibrant content view, similar to what you would find with netflix or prime video. for reference, during my testing period, some categories included starz originals, julia roberts, halloween, and the bald and the beautiful. the series and movies sections also break down into various sections, including action, comedy just added, and popular. these categories are consistent with what you will find on the web interface. selecting individual show and movie titles gives you more information about the content. you get the option to play, download, share, or add it to the my list section. the ability to watch shows offline is always a great feature to have for long distance travelers, commuters, or even people who are just away from home or a reliable wi-fi network. starz was one of the first streaming services to offer this functionality, and it works similarly to those that have since followed. you can download most movies and shows, but note that titles will self-delete two weeks after you initially download them and may also be removed due to expired licenses. performance and accessibility i tested starz's web and mobile app streaming performance over a variety of wi-fi connections, including pcmag's corporate wi-fi (50mbps download). starz launched streams consistently and the app didn't lag when i scrubbed to various parts of the video. for reference, over the same internet connection, it took around a minute and a half to download an hour-long episode of power in high quality. make sure you are connected to wi-fi before you commence any downloads so you don't end up paying cellular data fees. annoyingly, starz plays a pre-roll ad at the beginning of a show or movie. these clips highlight content from starz library, so they are not quite as bad as traditional cable ads, but it's still not an ideal user experience. amazon prime video and hbo now are also guilty of this self-promotion practice.  starz says most of its streaming content is available in 1080p, which is fine, but not up to the technical prowess of netflix or amazon prime video. both of those services offer a respectable amount of 4k and high dynamic range (hdr) content. starz recommends network download speeds of at least 6mbps for the best experience, which shouldn't pose a problem for the majority of users. while the playback screen does include a closed caption toggle, starz is missing some of the customization options (including text size, font, positioning) that other services, such as hulu and netflix, build into their players. you can also forget about robust accessibility features such as amazon prime video's audio descriptions. this option adds contextual audio notes about scene changes and character movements for select shows. starz: movies and more starz stacks up moderately well against on-demand streaming services, mostly thanks to its extensive movie library and decent, but not exceptional, line up of original shows. still, the mobile and desktop apps are not quite as slick as those of other services and it lacks some high-end accessibility options and technical capabilities. if you do particularly enjoy starz's content, you shouldn't hesitate to sign up; it's priced moderately and includes conveniences such as offline downloads on mobile. otherwise, we recommend some combination of editors' choices netflix, hulu, and sling tv. if you do go that route, you can always buy starz's original shows when they release on itunes, if you're an american gods or outlander fan.    starz   good             at     bottom line: starz offers an expansive movie library and a moderate sampling of original shows, but its app experience doesn't feel as premium or stable as the competition's.        first lookssoftware reviewsproduct guidesinternetstarz       more inside pcmag.com the best billing and invoicing

even if you have no good reason to justify buying one, you have to admit that drones are cool. some models out there are glorified tech toys, but most models we highlight here are fit for use in imaging and cinematic applications small and large. if you think you can use a flying camera in your next project, there's some good news\u2014the tech has come a long way in a very short time. there are models on the market now that put earlier copters to shame in terms of video quality and stabilization. and now the bad news. you get what you pay for, and if you want an aerial video platform that can capture stunning footage, you need to be ready to spend some cash. because drones are such pricey propositions, it pays to do your research before buying one. we've tested many of the ready-to-fly models on the market to determine what's important to look for, and the best models available.  see how we test drones there are low-cost drones on the market (we've rounded some of the top-rated options under $100 on amazon), but you're still looking at spending a few hundred dollars to get a solid model that's stable in flight with an excellent integrated camera.  the drones we review are ready-to-fly models, so you can use them right out of the box. in most cases you'll need to bring your own android or ios device to view the camera feed in real-time, but we've reviewed a few models that have an android tablet built into the remote control. we haven't delved into covering true pro models, which require you to get out a soldering iron and install flight control systems and custom gimbals that can accommodate an slr or mirrorless camera. drone safety and regulations almost all of the models featured here have some safety features. even the bebop 2, which isn't built for long-distance flight, includes a gps and automatic return-to-home functionality. if your control signal is interrupted, or if the battery gets down too low (most drones can only fly for about 20 minutes on a single battery charge), you drone will start to head back to its takeoff point and land. flyaways still happen, and there are horror stories on various web discussion forums. of course, negative experiences are amplified in this context, simply because uneventful flights that don't result in a crash or missing drone aren't hot topics for discussion. if you're flying within the united states, you need to take heed of faa guidelines\u2014or be prepared to face potential fines or jail time. there are no-fly zones set by the faa, so don't take off if you're near an airport without notifying the control tower first. and, even if you're out in the middle of nowhere, don't take your drone above 400 feet. most drones are set to obey these regulations out of the box, but controlling a quadcopter is just like driving a car\u2014even if you missed seeing that speed limit sign, you're still liable to pay the ticket. be sure to read up on the current faa guidelines before buying. racing and toy drones there are a number of products on the market that are sold as drones, but don't quite fit the bill. remote-controlled aircraft have been around for ages. (check out this clip from magnum, p.i. if you don't believe me, or just want to see tom selleck in a bathrobe.) but with the recent surge in popularity, quadcopters that would simply be sold as rc products are now being tagged as drones. these products don't include gps stabilization, return-to-home functionality, and other automated flight modes that make a drone a drone. we've reviewed a handful of these products and placed them in our toy reviews category. if you're interested in something you can use on the international drone racing association, keep your eyes tuned there for reviews. dji's dominance dji models currently dominate our top picks, and there's a good reason for that. the company is simply a few steps ahead of its competition right now, and has a product catalog with models at various price points, which take up a good number of the slots in our top ten. it made a huge splash with its iconic phantom series, and now makes the best small drones we've tested in the form of the mavic series.  dji's pro line is dubbed inspire, and is currently in its second generation. inspire models offer functionality well beyond what you get with a phantom, including dual-operator support\u2014one person flying and the other working the camera\u2014as well as interchangeable lenses and camera modules, a raw cinema workflow, and retractable landing gear. big drones, small drones for a long time, the dji phantom series was about as small as you could go if you wanted to get a full-featured drone that maintains stability in the air and includes strong safety features. that's no longer the case. hikers and travel photographers appreciate a small, light kit, and they can now can now get a drone that fits into a backpack. we've got a couple small models in our top ten, and expect to add a few more as the space develops further. we are currently testing several candidates, including the dji mavic 2 pro and zoom, the parrot anafi, and the yuneec mantis. of course, not every small drone is a top flyer. some are barely capable of getting off the ground and require you to use your smartphone as a remote control, which makes for a sloppy control experience. make sure to read reviews before spending hard-earned cash on a compact quadcopter. dji's competition yuneec is dji's major competition in the consumer market. its typhoon series competes with dji's phantom line and offers some features that phantoms don't provide, including a freely rotating camera on the typhoon h and h plus. it also has smaller models, the breeze and mantis, to appeal to pilots who want a more user-friendly, casual drone experience. powervision is a newer player in the us market. it's announced two copters\u2014the consumer-friendly poweregg and the pro-grade powereye, and has dipped its toes in the underwater uav market with the powerray, powerdolphin, and powerseeker. also making headway in the us is autel robotics. its line of x-star drones look like dji phantoms that have been dipped in bright orange paint, and it announced a mavic pro competitor, the evo, at the most recent ces. we've not yet had the opportunity to review them, but they compare favorably with dji models in terms of price. gopro made a drone, the karma. but after a rocky launch, which involved a massive recall, and underwhelming performance in the market, the company decided to pull the plug on drone development. you can still buy a karma while supplies last (at a discount), but there are better options out there. 3d robotics, which took a swing with its solo drone, has exited the consumer market\u2014the solo is now only on sale at closeout prices. that's a shame, as the solo delivers a lot of innovative features and would be a stellar choice for gopro users if it weren't hampered by subpar battery life and a gps that's slow to lock on to satellites.  pro models the dji inspire 2 is aimed at professional cinematographers, news organizations, and independent filmmakers. and it's priced as such\u2014its $3,000 msrp doesn't include a camera. you have the option of adding a 1-inch sensor fixed-lens camera, a micro four thirds interchangeable lens model, or a super35mm cinema mount with its own proprietary lens system and support for 6k video capture. yuneec also has a model with a micro four thirds camera. its tornado h920 is a huge drone with six rotors and room to hold three batteries, giving it an unheard of 42-minute flight capability. its cgo4 camera is essentially a custom version of the panasonic gh4, a favorite of many a terrestrial videographer. it doesn't record uncompressed video like the inspire 2, but it's less expensive. ultimately, you can't go wrong with any of the models listed here. for the latest

with a conventional screen paired with an e-ink display that you use for both writing and typing.  oct. 26, 2018   tom brant       with an e ink display instead of a keyboard, plus an extraordinarily thin chassis, the lenovo yoga book c930 ($949.99) comes very close to being a futuristic tablet pc of the sort you might recognize from a tv show or movie like hbo's westworld. but despite looking 22nd-century and having novel features like the ability to translate your drawings from an e ink screen to the main quad hd display, the yoga book is hobbled by its sluggish computing performance. that's especially unfortunate since the yoga c930 is a significantly upgraded and more expensive replacement for the original yoga book. no atoms here gone is the atom x5 processor of the original. instead, the yoga book c930 offers an intel core i5 y-series cpu. it's one of intel's lowest-powered core mobile chips, but it's still far more powerful than the atom is. that should mean a much snappier windows experience, especially when it comes to switching between apps and navigating through feature-rich websites, but in practice the yoga book is still deficient in this area compared with its similarly priced competitors.  also gone is the option to configure a yoga book with android. the yoga book c930 is windows-only, which is probably a good thing considering that the era of using android as a tablet operating system seems to be waning. pcmag reviewed the android version of the original yoga book, which cost $499, so the operating system and cost difference precludes a direct performance comparison between it and the c930.  still, the yoga book's key strength has nothing to do with computing performance. instead, you'll buy this unique machine mainly for its diminutive form factor\u2014it's the only convertible hybrid laptop i've used that fits comfortably in one hand\u2014as well as its e ink display that functions as the keyboard, a note-taking and sketch pad, and much more.  the entire package measures 0.39 by 10.25 by 7.1 inches (hwd) and weighs 1.71 pounds. that's incredibly thin and light for a windows laptop, though slightly heavier than the 1.52-pound original yoga book. the smallest convertibles pcmag has reviewed recently have 12-inch displays, such as the lenovo yoga 720 (0.6 by 11.5 by 8 inches, 2.53 pounds). the yoga book is so much smaller and lighter mostly because of its smaller 10.8-inch display, a size that's more common in tablets like the apple ipad than in traditional laptops.  as brilliant and vivid as the quad hd (2,560-by-1,600-pixel) display is, it's still not the most visually arresting part of the yoga book. that honor belongs to the second display that faces it on the laptop's other half, where you'd expect to find the keyboard on a conventional laptop. it's the same size as the main screen, but it uses e ink instead of traditional lcds or leds. the result is a monochrome display with a painfully slow refresh rate, but also one that consumes a minuscule amount of energy and is unaffected by bright ambient light.   the yoga book c930's e ink display features three modes. by default it's a keyboard, but you can tap a row of icons in the upper right corner to transform it into a digital slate similar to the wacom bamboo folio, or an ereader similar to the amazon kindle.  the e ink display on the original yoga book was great as a pressure-sensitive drawing surface, but it suffered as an actual keyboard. not so with the new version. although the keys themselves are still flat and virtual, its response time seems to be greatly improved, with none of the issues around slow auto-correct and overly powerful haptic feedback that were evident on the original yoga book. i certainly wouldn't write a novel on the yoga book c930, but other than the inability to find my way around the keyboard by feel, i had no problems typing a few sentences at a time without making mistakes.  you can activate the vibrating feedback and turn response sounds on or off by tapping the settings menu in the upper right hand corner. there, you'll also find options for customizing lenovo's unique touchpad solution. by default, the touchpad is hidden and appears only when you tap in the area below the spacebar, which gives the keyboard more room. you can also choose to shrink the keyboard to make room for a permanent touchpad, but i don't recommend this since activating the touchpad whenever you need it is far easier than typing on cramped keys. the included wacom active pen offers 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, connects via bluetooth, and uses disposable aaa batteries. it attaches to the back of the display lid with a powerful handy magnet when you're not using it, and it's far more accurate and precise than a cheap capacitive stylus. you can use it for drawing or navigating through windows 10 on the primary display, or use it on the e ink display in note mode. the selling point here is that you can flip the hinge 360 degrees, turn off the main display, and take notes or make drawings while consuming very little power. when you're done, you can then draw a circle around your words or images and copy them to the clipboard, from which you can then paste them into the windows app of your choice, including an optical character recognition (ocr) app. it's a nifty and novel experience, but in my testing, drawing and writing on the e ink display was no easier than using the stylus on the main display, due primarily to the sluggish refresh rate.  equally novel is the possibility of using the e ink display as an ereader. in fact, the yoga book c930 has the potential to replace your laptop, your tablet, and your kindle. in practice, though, there's currently no support for any ebook file formats, which limits you to displaying pdfs and image files. at least the process for transferring these files to the e ink display is straightforward\u2014you can navigate the windows file structure directly on the display. lenovo plans to add support for epub and mobi ebook formats next year. until that happens, the reader portion of the yoga book c930 is mostly a gimmick. the most gimmicky feature of all, though, is the solution lenovo came up with for opening the display lid. since there's no lip of any kind, the two halves of the yoga book c930 line up perfectly, making it nearly impossible to prise them open with your fingertips. so, thanks to an ingenious use of magnets and motion detection, you can knock twice on the outside of the lid to pop it open.  it's quite futuristic\u2014when it works, which unfortunately only happened about half of the time during several days of testing. more concerning, the yoga book c930 would occasionally pop open of its own accord when i set it down firmly on a table. if you can't get it to open by knocking, you can also press twice on the side-mounted power button to pop open the lid. the two halves of the yoga book c930 connect using lenovo's iconic watchband-style hinge. interestingly, this style of hinge is disappearing from lenovo's flagship convertible laptop, the new yoga c930, in favor of another unique hinge design, this one with a built-in speaker. speaking of the yoga c930, it will be very easy for the nomenclature to confuse shoppers. the yoga c930 is a larger 14-inch convertible laptop, with a more powerful u-series intel core i5 or core i7 processor and a conventional keyboard. add a \"book\" to the name, and you get the very different model i'm reviewing here, with the 10-inch screen and the e ink lower half.  for nearly a grand, needs more pep our review unit has 4gb of memory and a 128gb ssd, which precludes using it for marathon browsing sessions with lots of tabs open or as a repository for your 4k movie collection. the port selection amounts to two usb type-c ports, either of which can charge the yoga book c930. they replace the micro usb and micro hdmi ports on the original yoga book, which means connecting to external displays will require a dongle. on the plus side, there's a slot on the left edge that accepts both micro sd cards to boost storage and a sim card to provide cellular connectivity. as mentioned earlier, lenovo says it plans to sell a 4g lte version, something that it rarely offers with its other consumer laptops, although the review unit on hand here is not so equipped. bluetooth 4.2 and 802.11ac wi-fi round out the wireless options.  inside, the intel core i5-7y54 results in the yoga book c930 receiving disappointing performance scores compared with other laptops in its price range. the \"y\" in the processor name indicates that this cpu is efficient enough to require no cooling fan. that means the yoga book c930 is almost silent under any workload, though it does get quite warm to the touch. it also means that this laptop is a significantly worse performer on specialized tasks such as multimedia editing. it was the slowest among a group of five competing convertible laptops on our handbrake video-encoding test (3 minutes and 5 seconds) and cinebench 3d rendering test (a score of 236).  although it's clear from the yoga book c930's physical appearance that it's designed for note-taking and doodling rather than 3d rendering, it's tough to stomach that you could spend roughly the same amount of money on a larger, more capable machine like the non-\"book\" yoga c930. even the cheaper dell inspiron 13 7000 and acer spin 3 performed far better on the multimedia tests. the story is much the same when it comes to the general-purpose pcmark 8 benchmark, which simulates common computing tasks such as word processing and web browsing. the yoga book c930's score of 2,661 on this test is far below the 3,000 minimum that represents lag-free everyday performance. indeed, i did experience occasional sluggishness during most of my real-world testing with the yoga book c930. everything from resizing app windows to navigating quickly back and forth between web pages and tabs in microsoft edge resulted in noticeable lag.  see how we test laptops neither is the yoga book c930 adept at playing demanding games, although at least this is one deficiency that it shares with the rest of its competitors, almost all of which offer frame rates far below the minimum 30 frames per second we consider acceptable for smooth gameplay on the heaven and valley gaming simulations. the one bright spot when it comes to performance is battery life. lasting 10 hours on our battery-rundown test means that you should be able to get through a full day of plugged-in use. the laptop actually lasted a full weekend away from a power outlet in my testing, although i used it only for brief web searches during that time. a specialized laptop, a bit too dear unfortunately, two major downsides shadow lenovo's improvements to the yoga book. many prospective owners who plan to use this laptop for light-duty tasks like taking notes will be able to live with the lackluster computing performance. but the price increase is harder to stomach. the original windows yoga book, which is no longer available for purchase, started at $549. the yoga book c930 is $949.99, a whopping 73 percent uptick. that means the yoga book c930 is now competing with premium ultraportable laptops, in addition to tablets like the far less expensive apple ipad. the e ink display and other novel features simply don't justify this additional expense. ultimately, the yoga book c930 is a great conversation piece if you can afford it, but sensible shoppers would do better to buy a larger convertible laptop for roughly the same money. (just drop the \"book\" from the name, and you have a great alternative right there.)   lenovo yoga book c930   good             at     bottom line: the lenovo yoga book c930's unique e ink display lets you type, jot notes, and make sketches, but this and other futuristic features of this 2-in-1 convertible don't quite justify its price.        laptop computers & ...lenovo yoga book ...

c930 2-in-1 convertible laptop promises to be even better than its winning predecessor.  oct. 26, 2018   tom brant          one of the few things the otherwise-excellent  lenovo yoga 920 2-in-1 convertible laptop is missing is a convenient place to store its digital stylus. that's fixed with the yoga 920's replacement, the yoga c930 (starts at $999, $1,299 as tested). instead of an awkward plastic stylus holder that plugs into a usb port, the yoga c930 comes with a pen \"garage,\" a small channel built into the back edge that holds the active stylus when it's not in use. several other minor improvements, including a revamped hinge and an hdr display, help make the yoga c930 even better than the yoga 920 it replaces, earning it an editors' choice award for best convertible laptop. the yoga line, redefined the yoga c930 derives its name from lenovo's new naming convention. the \"yoga\" family name originally signified the ability to rotate the laptop's screen 360 degrees to transform it into a tablet, once a novel feature. now that convertible laptop designs are commonplace, lenovo bestows the yoga moniker on its entire line of premium consumer laptops, even if the product happens to be a conventional laptop without a rotating hinge.   in fact, that very rotating hinge, which is a piece of luxury-watchband-style bling on the yoga 920, is now a more ordinary-looking single piece of metal on the yoga c930. but the new hinge has its own charms. not only does its housing make room for the stylus holder on the upper right edge, but it houses a speaker grille that conceals two tweeters, giving it a pleasingly perforated look.  the new speaker position should theoretically result in better sound, since the tweeters face outward regardless of whether the laptop is in laptop or tablet mode. the yoga 920's downward-firing speakers on the bottom of the chassis means that they're most powerful when you use the yoga 920 in tent or \"a-frame\" mode, so that the speakers face you. in that case, in tablet and laptop configurations, the sound is a bit muffled.  in practice, however, the yoga c930's sound still isn't as good in tent mode as it is in laptop mode, especially when you're listening to music. there's a noticeable muffling effect when you flip the screen over. the yoga c930's base features two additional speaker grilles that deliver bass. when you do flip the screen over, the laptop transforms into a tablet, albeit an unwieldy one given the 3.1-pound weight of pcmag's review unit. the yoga c930 shares this unwieldiness with pretty much every other convertible laptop of its screen size. if you plan on using your device primarily in tablet mode, you'll want to opt instead for a dedicated windows tablet like the microsoft surface pro; some such machines come with a detachable keyboard for occasional laptop use.  the yoga c930 measures 0.57 by 8.9 by 12.68 inches (hwd), which is par for the course for a 13-inch laptop or convertible. the 13-inch macbook pro measures 0.59 by 11.97 by 8.36 inches, for instance, while the dell inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 (5379) measures 0.77 by 12.76 by 8.85 inches. what's impressive about the yoga c930 is that it fits a larger screen (13.9 inches) into this form factor. even more impressive: its dimensions are barely different from those of the yoga 920 (0.55 by 12.72 by 8.8 inches), despite the addition of the integrated pen slot. the spring-loaded pen slot, located in the right corner of the laptop's rear edge, is a nifty feature. its main benefit is helping you not lose the included stylus when you're transporting the laptop, but it also serves as a means of charging its built-in battery. the stylus itself is easy to use and quite precise, thanks to tilt detection and pressure sensitivity. the only downside is that lenovo reduced it in size to fit in the small garage, which means it's considerably smaller than the yoga 920's marker-like digital pen. alexa will hear you now in addition to the new hinge and the integrated stylus holder, other improvements in the yoga c930 include new far-range microphones that will work with voice assistants like microsoft's cortana and amazon's alexa. lenovo has been at the forefront of alexa's integration with windows 10, first announcing support at ces 2018 in january. but that integration has proven to be a slow process, with alexa's full capabilities finally arriving in august. to enable them on the yoga c930, you can type \"alexa\" in the search field on the windows 10 taskbar. you'll first be prompted to sign in to your microsoft account, then your amazon account. once everything is set up, you can say \"hey, cortana, open alexa.\" the yoga c930 will then function just like an amazon echo speaker or other alexa-enabled device. your spoken commands are even displayed on the screen. thanks to the laptop's far-field microphones, the yoga c930 picked up voice commands and understood what i was asking no matter where i was in a large room of about 900 square feet. that means it should function very well in an open-plan apartment or the living and dining area of a small house. you can configure the microphones so they'll wake up the laptop from sleep mode when you utter a cortana command, but to speak with alexa, you'll have to log in to your account first. a fingerprint reader on the yoga c930's keyboard deck should make that windows sign-in easier, but it failed to recognize my fingerprint about a third of the time over several days of use. some versions of the yoga c930 will include infrared (ir) sensors to let you log in using face recognition, but either way, you'll still have to walk over to the laptop, which could be inconvenient if, say, you're trying to look up something while you're cooking. if you don't opt for the ir sensors, you'll instead get a camera with a built-in sliding shutter to provide peace of mind if you're worried about hackers spying on you. picture quality from the 720p webcam is decent for casual video conferences, though it's lacking compared with high-end smartphone cameras, many of which can shoot in 4k. i appreciate that the webcam also has an unobtrusive built-in physical sliding door, which prevents you from having to use a snip of masking tape to thwart potential privacy-invading hackers. the shutter and its lever are so small and well-integrated that i eventually forgot they were even there.  the yoga c930 comes in several different color options besides gray, and lenovo also plans to offer an option to add a futuristic glass display lid. i didn't particularly like the blue wavy glass lid the company showed me during a brief demo, however. it would certainly raise eyebrows in a conference room.   two screen options most of the other features of the yoga c930 remain unchanged from its yoga 920 predecessor. processor options include energy-sipping 8th generation intel core i5 or core i7 processors, full hd (1,920 by 1,080) or 4k (3,840 by 2,160) touch screens, two usb type-c ports with thunderbolt 3 support, a usb 3.1 gen 2 port, and a headphone jack. unfortunately, there's no memory-card reader, not even a microsd card slot. wireless connectivity options include 802.11ac wi-fi and bluetooth. the unit i tested is equipped with the full hd display option, which offered excellent picture quality in laptop mode. if you've ever used a higher-resolution tablet like an apple ipad, you might want to step up to the 4k version, though. i definitely noticed graininess when holding the yoga c930 up close to my face in tablet mode. either resolution option comes with support for dolby vision, a high dynamic range (hdr) technology that can display a wider range of color and contrast.  you'll only notice the difference if you're watching a video or playing a game that also supports dolby vision, and the wider color range is more apparent on a 4k screen, but even so, i certainly noticed the difference while watching some short nature clips on youtube in hdr at full hd (1080p) resolution. storage options are plentiful, ranging from 256gb to 2tb, and each capacity uses the cutting-edge pci express ssd interface for fast data access. the test model i have in hand has a 256gb drive. the buttonless, clickable touchpad and backlit keyboard feel quite sturdy, but clicks and button presses are shallow. the depth of the key plunge is not nearly as luxurious as with the keys on lenovo's thinkpad lineup, which are the most comfortable laptop keys i've ever typed on.  a modest performance increase for slightly less money than the configuration of the yoga 920 i tested last year, pcmag's yoga c930 includes most of the same internal components. that includes the 8th generation \"kaby lake r\" intel core i7-8550u processor (a quad-core chip) and its built-in intel uhd graphics 620. but the yoga c930 eked out slightly better performance on many of our benchmark tests than its predecessor did, a feat for which the c930's increased 12gb memory complement is mostly responsible. (the yoga 920 unit we tested had 8gb of ram.)  i noticed a modest bump of a few hundred points on the all-encompassing pcmark 8 benchmark (3,284 for the yoga 920; 3,575 for the yoga c930) using the work conventional preset, which simulates web browsing, video conferencing, and other common office tasks. anything above 3,000 on this test is a solid score. similarly small performance improvements occurred on the cinebench 3d and the handbrake video-rendering tests, although the yoga c930 took slightly longer to apply a series of images in our photoshop cs6 test than the yoga 920 did (2 minutes and 54 seconds vs. 3:04). still, the results here show that the yoga c930 is a reasonable alternative to a mobile workstation or a tricked-out apple macbook pro if you need to do some light video editing or image manipulation in the field. in terms of overall feel, the laptop never felt sluggish, even with multiple browser tabs open, some with streaming video. unfortunatley, the laptop ships with bloatware from microsoft (minecraft, candy crush, and similar games), as well as a free trial of mcafee livesafe, complete with pesky upgrade reminders.  the yoga c930 is not a reasonable alternative to a gaming laptop, as the graphics performance results clearly indicate. the only laptop shown above in our comparison set that performed reasonably well on these tests is the asus zenbook flip 14, thanks to its modest geforce mx150 dedicated gpu. don't try to play anything other than browser-based games on the yoga c930 unless you're willing to dial down the game's screen resolution and quality settings to their minimums. at a bit less than 19 hours on our rundown test, the lenovo yoga c930's battery gave out slightly sooner than the yoga 920's, which lasted for more than 22 hours. still, any laptop than lasts for more than 15 hours has a good chance of getting you through an entire workday or an entire cross-country flight without plugging in. this is a superb result.  an excellent convertible laptop the lenovo yoga c930 gets even more right about the convertible laptop form factor than its predecessor did. that's no small achievement; the yoga 920 set the bar very high. if you're looking for a windows laptop that you can occasionally use as a tablet for drawing or watching movies, it doesn't get much better than this.   lenovo yoga c930   excellent                at     bottom line: with a revamped hinge, an integrated stylus, and a sleek design, lenovo's yoga c930 2-in-1 convertible laptop is even better than its winning predecessor.         laptop

the galaxy s9+ is just as good, and now louder.  left to right: galaxy s9+, galaxy s9 the phone supports both voice-over-lte and wi-fi calling, although you may need a carrier-specific unit to get those features. the unlocked model supports wi-fi calling on t-mobile and sprint, but you'll need a carrier-branded unit for wi-fi calling on at&t and verizon. hot chips       the galaxy s9+ runs android 8.0 oreo on the first snapdragon 845 processor we've seen in the us. this model has 6gb of ram, while the smaller s9 has 4gb. the snapdragon 845 has four cores running at 2.8ghz and four at 1.7ghz. it doesn't appear to bring massively more cpu power to the table, but the improvements on graphics, lte, and wi-fi are quite noticeable. the snapdragon 845 benchmarks better than any other android phone; how it compares with the iphone depends on which benchmark you're using. on geekbench, which focuses on cpu performance, the iphone x beats the s9+ with scores of 4269 single-core and 10403 multi-core, compared with the s9+'s 2278 and 8379. but antutu shows the opposite result: the galaxy s9+ got 267,233 compared with the iphone x's 233,592, largely because of a better 3d performance score. cross-platform benchmarks are not terribly useful. and on pcmark, well, our score of 7273 is similar to the pixel 2 phones, although it's noticeably higher than the 6800 we got on the galaxy s8.  pcmark test results browser benchmarks show a modest improvement over snapdragon 835-based phones. those usually get about 63 to 65 on the jetstream javascript benchmark and 250 or so on browsermark; here, we got 69.97 on jetstream and 270 on browsermark.       graphics benchmarks comparing the s9+ with other android phones, though, are heartening. on the gfxbench car crash test, the s9+ got 35fps offscreen, while snapdragon 835 phones only get 24 to 25 fps. that's a really nice performance bump.  see how we test phones the phone has a category 18 lte modem that can hit maximum theoretical speeds of 1.2gbps, 20 percent faster than the previous generation of high-end phones. we tested the unlocked variant, and were happy to see that it has all the bands used by each of the us carriers, including (for at&t, t-mobile, and verizon) the new 5ghz laa band that recently gave us speeds of over 500mbps on t-mobile. the phone has 4x4 mimo antennas on bands 2, 4, 7, 30, 41, and 66. (if you're curious about the full lte band list, including roaming bands used mostly in other countries, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12,13, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 66, 71.) there's good news here for all carriers. the phone can support 12 streams of data to previous devices' 10, and can do 4x4 mimo on three bands simultaneously compared with the previous devices' two. that means more flexibility to squeeze greater speeds out of each cell site on every carrier. on at&t, 4x4 mimo on band 30 is new. on sprint, the s8+ lacks 4x4 mimo on the critical band 41, so you'll see much faster speeds on an s9+. on t-mobile, the s9+ brings in the new rural band 71 for extended coverage, which isn't on the s8+. the s7 doesn't have either of these features, and no iphone has them, either. when a carrier sim is put in the unlocked phone, the phone adapts to whatever that carrier's bands and aggregation strategies are.            to test rf, we brought the s9+ and a galaxy note 8 to a t-mobile cell site of verified quality. we got slightly better signal and latency on the s9+ than on the note 8. now, that could be hardware, or it could be software, and we plan to look into this further, but there's no question that we're talking top-of-the-line lte performance. we were also very pleasantly surprised by the s9+'s stellar wi-fi performance when compared with the s8+ on the 5ghz band. in good signal conditions on a 150mbps symmetrical connection, we got 130 to 150mbps down on the s8+, but only 70 to 80mbps up. on the s9+, we got 135 to 150mbps up. and as we went farther from the router and through walls, the s8+'s connection decayed before the s9+'s did: with a middling link, we got 77mbps down and 40mbps up on the s8+, but still a solid 154mbps down and 130mbps up on the s9+. as far as battery goes, the s9+ has a 3,500mah cell. it outran our 10-hour streaming youtube video, with five percent life, which bodes very well for battery life. we'll post more battery results as we run them. android-wise, samsung's extensions to google's operating system here are identical to those from last year. beyond the camera modes, which we'll discuss below, the s9+ has samsung's \"edge\" functionality to drag in widgets from the side of the screen, and supports samsung's dex docking stations to turn the phone into a desktop pc. both features are useful, but probably won't be used as often as samsung would like. brighter vision       the galaxy s9+ has two primary 12mp cameras, stacked on top of one another on the back. both the s9 and s9+ have new, dual-aperture lenses that snap from f/2.4 or f/1.5 depending on lighting conditions. at light levels under 100 lux\u2014basically indoor lighting\u2014they'll pop open to f/1.5, letting more light in. you can also control the change manually in the camera's pro mode. you can actually see the iris open up if you look closely at the camera. the front-facing f/1.7, 8mp camera is completely identical to the galaxy s8's in our testing, although it has a new wide selfie mode that combines selfie with a partial panorama, and a software-operated selfie bokeh mode. from a hardware perspective, the s9+ delivers on its promises. its bright lens and sensor deliver images that exceed other smartphones in dim light, and on-sensor autofocus locks onto subjects very quickly. but the software employs some very aggressive sharpening we're not big fans of.  on the s9+, the dual-aperture lens is the top one. the bottom one is an f/2.4 lens at 2x zoom. both have optical image stabilization. the camera ui is a little slippery and sticky. i'm confident this will get worked out in a firmware update, but scrolling across the different camera modes\u2014pro, auto, slow-mo, etcetera\u2014sometimes jumps ahead and sometimes feels stilted, which is frustrating.       the idea behind the dual-aperture camera option is simple: crisper images when shooting in bright light with an f/2.4 prime, and lower isos in very dim conditions with f/1.5. an f/1.5 lens captures about 2.6 times the light as an f/2.4. of course, you'll likely compare it with other handsets as opposed to dedicated cameras. the note 8 sports an f/1.7 prime, giving the s9+ a more modest 30 percent advantage in gathering light. the iphone 8, 8 plus, and x have an f/1.8 main lens, which means the s9+ gobbles up about 45 percent more light. this translates into either a shorter shutter speed, lower iso, or combination of both when working in dim light. smartphone camera image quality suffers at high iso settings, so this is a definite plus when snapping pics of your dinner in a fancy restaurant, or a shot of your bestie at the trendiest cocktail lounge in town. a brighter lens is great, but due to some software choices by samsung, the actual results are mixed. at its default, jpg output setting images are significantly oversharpened. close examination shows odd artifacts, especially in high-contrast areas\u2014say a dark object against a bright sky, a common situation in landscape and architectural photography. even when viewed at screen resolution you can see modest halos in these areas. this is fixable in software.      it's not a problem with the sensor. we looked at raw photos too and they look great. take a look at the comparison above, at a pixel level, with the jpg output at the left, a mostly untouched raw in the center (we dialed down the exposure by a half-stop to better match the jpg), and a raw processed to taste (+25 contrast, -40 highlights, +35 shadows, -25 blacks, and +15 clarity) in lightroom at the far right. you can definitely get more natural photos, with crisp lines and without the too-sharp look, with a little bit of processing.       the effect is more pronounced at lower iso settings. as we move to the high iso range\u2014the s9+ can be set manually up to iso 800\u2014we see how the sharpened images, coupled with improvements in the underlying sensor technology, actually deliver more detail than the cameras from the s8+/note 8 and iphone 8/plus/x. but it's not just the jpg engine that's doing it\u2014the raw sensor output from the s9+ shows more detail and less noise at iso 800 than the note 8 or iphone 8 plus main cameras\u2014which means it's also better than those phones in dim light.      while the s9's hardware is better than any competing phone, samsung's software choices in jpg encoding mean the jpg output from competing phones, including samsung's own note 8 and s8, the google pixel 2 xl, and this year's iphones, all look more natural. we've include a side-by-side comparison of an image of the same subject above, with the s8+ on the left and s9+ on the right (click for a larger version). even at screen resolution the difference is clear\u2014the s8+ captures a ton of detail, but does so without showing unnatural edges. the s9 is crisper than real life, like it's pushing a clarity adjustment slider all the way to the right. luckily, serious smartphone photgraphers can get around this. you can shoot in raw and process photos using a phone or desktop app\u2014i'm a big fan of the film looks offered by vsco, which is available for android, but there are dozens of options out there. or you can tune the jpg output in the pro camera mode to one of several preset looks: breezy, vivid, nostalgic, soft, and serene. breezy is closer to what samsung did with the s8 and note 8 in color tone, but still a bit too sharpened. nostalgic, soft, and serene dial it way back, but they're more special effect than an everyday shooting look. videos are nicely optically stabilized, both at 1x and 2x, in up to 4k at 60 frames per second. the device doesn't capture 4k hdr, though, and 4k60 capture is limited to five minutes per video.       samsung also put memory right under the image sensor, the same way sony has, to enable 960fps slow-motion. the gs9+ can capture up to 20, 0.2-second clips at that super-slow-mo level; it needs a moment to flush the memory buffer out after each clip. because it's really difficult to guess which 0.2-second you're going to want, the camera also has an auto-detect mode where it starts recording normal video, and then kicks into super-slow-mo when it detects motion in the frame. the super-slo-mo clip becomes a short video, but the gs9 also creates three 4mb highlight gifs that have much smaller file sizes than the video, and are easier to share. that's some pretty great handholding for anyone who wants to post their slow-mo quickly to social networks. i popped some balloons in slow-mo, and it worked fine. one thing to be aware of, though, is that the super-slow-mo mode only records at 720p, and the images can be very soft in indoor lighting. the more light you have at this speed, the better.  the uncanny emoji valley samsung's ar emoji are a cross between apple's animoji, which i haven't seen in the wild for months, and the cartoonish bitmoji, which are a hideous plague on the internet. the idea is that they construct a custom cartoon character from your face that can match your facial movements for photos and videos. the characters, though, live firmly in the uncanny valley, that creepy land of somewhat-realistic dolls and zombie creatures that make you wince, not laugh.            when i created a character for myself, it initially didn't look at all like me because it had the wrong hair and no glasses. tweaking the hair color, skin tone, and glasses helped a lot, but the animation still floated in that creepy realm between cartoonish and photorealistic. after thinking on it for a while, the problem wasn't that the face didn't look like me\u2014it's that the slight slackness and lag of the motion capture created the problem. that's part of why apple's animoji are all cartoon characters, which you don't expect human expressions from.  after getting over the initial shock, i realized that the ar emoji aren't bad at all when they're turned into gif stickers. the phone auto-generates a range of gifs from your image, and while they're ridiculous, they aren't disturbing, as you can see here. you can also use the s9's motion capture prowess with three cartoon characters and a variety of snapchat-like masks for your selfies. they all move a little stiffly, because the s9 doesn't have the 3d face-tracking camera the iphone x has on its front. branded disney characters are coming, samsung says, but the animations will have to get more fluid and mobile to be compelling. samsung's software story continues in the s9's new bixby camera modes. bixby is samsung's catch-all term for ai software features. it's a voice assistant, an extra home screen with informational widgets, and a bunch of intelligent camera modes. on the s8+, bixby's camera modes identifies wine bottles and other products, reads qr codes, and translates languages. on the s9+, you can count the calories in food and shop for makeup by putting it on your face as a snapchat-style filter.        the camera modes' quality varies, but they all feel like gimmicks you'll quickly forget about. unfortunately, the most useful one, language translation, doesn't work well on many languages. it gave me a sense of spanish and french in tests, but totally failed on bengali, hebrew, and russian, even though it says it supports those languages. the calorie counter mode is an awesome party trick and works surprisingly well, but it's of limited utility. ultimately, there's just nothing in bixby that would make you buy a phone, and little that is better than a combination of google assistant and some third-party apps like microsoft translate or bitesnap.  comparisons and conclusions i don't think the past 12 months make a great innovation year for smartphones. that doesn't mean we're seeing bad phones, it just means we aren't seeing game-changing phones. with in-display fingerprint sensors coming at the end of 2018 and 5g networks coming at the beginning of 2019, we're going to see some real innovation soon. for now, the s9+ just makes everything a little bit better. it brings you dual cameras, a big battery, and lots of memory for $839.99 unlocked. we think that's worth paying $120 more than you will for the smaller s9, and it's less than you'll pay for the galaxy note 8 or the iphone x. wireless carriers are charging more for this phone, but unless you need wi-fi calling on at&t or verizon, you should get the unlocked model\u2014it has no bloatware, better resale value, and supports all us carrier bands. this is an excellent phone, if an emotionally unexciting one. it's our editors' choice because it's the best at almost everything that other android phones do, and not far from the best at the rest (mostly, camera jpeg encoding).       if you have a galaxy s8, it's hard for me to argue that you toss away it away for a collection of meaningful but largely incremental improvements. if you have a galaxy s7 or s6, on the other hand, this is a major upgrade, especially in terms of connecting to your carrier's fastest network. compared with the note 8, get the note if you're going to use the pen. get an s9+ if you aren't.  the s9+ doesn't change the \"iphone or android?\" calculus much. it puts the galaxy line on par with the iphone 8 plus in terms of having dual cameras, but the song remains the same. i prefer the galaxy line over iphones right now because they have better radios, a real headphone jack, and what i think is a more attractive form factor, and the more i look at the iphone x notch, the more i don't like it. a lot of people still love ios for its elegant third-party applications and apple's absolutely unmatched network of high-quality service and support. they're not wrong. other android smartphones can absolutely bring a quality experience for less money. they're also not quite as good. the google pixel 2 xl, for instance, lacks the gs9+'s secondary camera, has a slightly slower processor, a slower modem, and doesn't have as gorgeous a screen. it does, however, encode better jpegs. the galaxy s9+ is the pinnacle of smartphone innovation right now. like the galaxy s8 did last year, it sets the bar for smartphone quality, and it's going to make life difficult for companies like motorola and sony that are also trying to sell $700+ smartphones. if you need a phone, price is no object, you aren't going to use a pen, and aren't set on an iphone, this is the one for you.       jim fisher contributed to this review.   samsung galaxy s9+     excellent           at    bottom line: it's not

(our 4k review unit of the spectre x360 13 is pricier, but the high-quality build is present in all units).      the build doesn't feel so flimsy that it might break if given a less-than-severe beating, but it's just disappointing compared with the similarly priced competition. the material does keep the system light at just 2.2 pounds, which was undoubtedly the deciding factor in its use. if keeping as light a bag as possible is your main goal, the notebook 9 pen may be your best bet\u2014the other systems mentioned come in closer to or just above 3 pounds, though that's still pretty petite. it measures 0.6 by 12.25 by 8 inches (hwd), so it has a nice and small footprint, leaving plenty of room in your bag. flip it and reverse it like the other systems, the notebook 9 pen is easily convertible. its dual hinges allow you to rotate the screen back from standard laptop all the way into tablet mode, or any point in between. as you may have guessed from the name, this laptop comes with an s pen stylus. it's included in the price and stored on the right side of the front edge. pressing in on the end pops it out of its slot so you can grab it, though i wish storing it was as easy. it's difficult to tell at a glance whether or not you're inserting it upside down, and if it's the wrong way, it can get jammed in the slot pretty effortlessly. you'll get used to it\u2014if there's any resistance at the very end, it's in the wrong way\u2014but i still accidentally got it stuck a couple times and needed to pry it out with another object.      pulling the pen from the slot brings up a digital menu, identical in design and similar in options to the menu on the samsung galaxy note 8. the unification of the menu design across smartphone and pc products is worth observing, and is something samsung touched on multiple times during my interview with them at ces. it speaks to their big picture approach for gaining mindshare and familiarity across product lines, and i'd expect more design cues and features to align across categories going forward. the options on this menu include new note, view notes, smart select, screen write, and show window (for second displays). smart select allows you to crop a section of the screen and turn it into an editable image, or even a gif. the latter is a cool feature (also available on the note 8) for making a quick animated image\u2014just select what you want, let it record for a few seconds (15 at most), hit stop, and save the gif. screen write is more traditional, capturing the entire current screen so you can doodle or take notes on top of what you were viewing.                    view all photos in gallery    the pen is of course most useful in tablet mode, in which you can place the laptop down flat on a table or in the crook of your arm to draw or write. the different options are useful for professional work like marking up a web page or document, or something more casual like making a quick joke to a friend. as with the note 8, jotting down a quick handwritten note may be easier than typing, but there may be users who never need to use the function. since the stylus is enough of a selling point on this system to make it into the name, you'll probably want to think how much utility you'd realistically get out of the stylus. samsung knows a thing or two about making screens, and this laptop's display is clear and vibrant. the 13-inch touch display bears a full hd resolution (1,920 by 1,080), and you're not getting qhd or 4k here, it is shared by much of the competition at this price and is suitable for the size. the quality of the screen helps you forget it's not a higher resolution, too, and is overall one of the laptop's highlights.      the keyboard offers a comfortable typing experience, with good travel on the keys without feeling overly bouncy. it's also backlit, though it's worth noting the lighting is strangely a blueish or off-white color instead of a standard clean white. the light doesn't come through the keycaps especially crisply, but is bright enough to still be helpful. the touchpad is smooth to pan and responsive to clicking. there's a fingerprint scanner for sign-in integrated into the right side of the keyboard, rather than off on its own or on the touchpad. i have no issue with the speakers either, which are loud enough for the size of the system and offer solid audio quality. ports aren't numerous, but varied enough to cover all the bases. there's a single usb 3.0 port on the right flank, next to a microsd slot and the power button, while the left side holds a usb-c port, an hdmi port, and the headphone jack. that's it as far as ports, but there's no glaring exclusion, and i like the inclusion of traditional usb and newer usb-c\u2014some of the thinner laptops out there have shifted entirely to usb-c, which can be inconvenient for legacy peripherals. inside, there's a 256gb ssd for storage, which is standard for this type of laptop. you may find yourself wanting more than that depending on the type of work you do, but the notebook 9 pen hardly stands apart here\u2014the yoga 920 and the xps 13 2-in-1 also include 256gb, while the pricier 4k spectre x360 13 offers 512gb. the notebook 9 pen also includes bluetooth, and a 720p front-facing webcam on the top bezel. samsung supports its laptops with a one-year warranty. speedy, short on stamina one of the notebook 9 pen's high points is its 1.8ghz intel core i7-8550u processor. it's an efficient kaby lake r model\u2014not quite as exciting as the coffee lake series that's coming to laptops soon\u2014and the same cpu found in the yoga 920. coupled with 8gb of memory, also like the yoga 920, the notebook 9 pen is proficient across the board for everyday tasks and media projects. it topped the yoga 920 on the pcmark 8 work conventional general productivity test, and was just slightly behind on the multimedia tests. the notebook 9 pen is quick overall; this class of laptop may not be powerful enough to make it a real workstation for intensive video or photo projects, but it can handle moderate workloads and your average processing or multitasking job.      one area where the notebook 9 pen severely lags behind the yoga 920, and indeed most of the competition, is battery life. the laptop managed 8 hours and 27 minutes on our rundown test, which is an acceptable time generally, but pales in comparison with the alternatives. the yoga 920 lasted for 22:38 on the same test, the xps 13 2-in-1 for 11:46, and the apple macbook pro 13-inch for 16:26. the closest competitor is the spectre x360 13 at 8:18, but shorter battery life is expected when the battery is powering a 4k screen. eight and a half hours will get you through most of a day with low to moderate use, but if you take a long flight, have your laptop on through much of the day off the charger, or take it out in the field, you'll definitely have to keep an eye out for power outlets. it's a concern users would rather not have, and when a product makes a point to be portable (with weight and convertibility), it's best if the battery can match.       see how we test laptops as with the rest of the category, 3d and gaming performance was a weak point. the integrated graphics included in processors (as opposed to the discrete graphics cards present in gaming systems) simply aren't up to the task beyond simple titles. if you'd like to just play hearthstone and some less intensive 2d games on the side, these laptops can handle them on lower settings, but definitely don't expect this system to serve as a gaming machine, or run titles well in hd. solid, not a standout the notebook 9 pen doesn't get anything monumentally wrong, but it doesn't justify its rather high price, either. its build is on the flimsy side, especially looking at the competition, and the battery life could be much better. it's an easy system to use, and it performs well, but there's nothing particularly noteworthy that would draw you to choose it over the alternatives. the pen is useful, but the lenovo offers an optional stylus of its own for the yoga, if that's something you're after. given the design, battery life, and general experience, the yoga 920 is still our top pick. this article originally appeared on pcmag.com.        1sleek design the notebook 9 pen is a simple, sleek laptop, all

a button to the right of the slot releases the pc. when the desktop is standing in the dock, it measures 14.96 by 6.9 by 7.87 inches and is similar to the size of some of the best small-form-factor gaming desktops out there, like the falcon northwest tiki and the corsair one pro. inside, the omen x is pretty well equipped. there's only one configuration available, which includes a 2.9ghz intel core i7-7820hk processor, 16gb of memory, and the mobile version of nvidia's geforce gtx 1080 graphics card. as the benchmark results below demonstrate, it's a solid gaming system built into a small body. vr backpack the omen x compact desktop is oddly shaped to make it a potentially wearable computer, but you can't wear it out of the box. the optional vr backpack lets you mount the computer on your back for vr gaming, or simple pc transport. but since so much of the desktop's design is built around, or at least made to work with, the vr backpack, it strikes us as odd that they aren't always sold together. the desktop is functional in its own right, though it's safe to say the market for the backpack add-on is pretty limited.  the name \"vr backpack\" is a misnomer; it's actually a padded harness with no pockets. instead, a raised, sturdy plastic surface with mounting points extends a few inches off of the back of the harness for holding the omen x compact desktop. the computer locks securely onto the mounting points, and stays in place until you press a small tab on the top of the plate. it's very easy to slide the computer into the harness, it locks in on its own, and it never felt like it was going to fall off during testing. the wearable part of the harness consists of two large, padded shoulder straps attached to a padded belt with a plastic buckle in the front. a smaller, unpadded nylon strap extends from the shoulder straps to buckle around your chest. the result is a comfortable, well-balanced fit that feels similar to a camper's pack. it's safe to say you're not going to look like the coolest-looking person in town wearing it, but you're not trying to win any fashion contests while playing at home. the $500 price seems steep for what amounts to a harness, two sets of batteries, and charging dock, though.  the omen x desktop includes an internal battery so it can work outside of the dock, but the backpack comes with hot-swappable batteries that provide the main juice. the backpack has battery holsters on either side, with power cables that screw into the bottom of the desktop while it's in the backpack. it's a little finicky to set up, but straightforward enough. the backpack comes with a charging base for the hot swappable batteries, which you power through a connection on the omen x compact desktop's dock. the batteries have power indicators, so you can see their status, and since there are four of them, you can always have a pair charging while the other is in use. (more on battery life below.) there are many parts involved here, and it's not the most elegant overall design. the desktop and dock on their own don't take up much room, but the power brick, battery-charging base, and harness together lead to desk sprawl pretty quickly. add to that the mixed reality headset and vr controllers, and you'll end up needing a a lot of space to store the entire setup. performance and battery life as a general-use desktop, the omen x impresses. the i7-7820hk processor and 16gb of memory led to good benchmark scores. its pcmark score isn't chart-topping, but it establishes the omen x as a speedy system for everyday use. the multimedia test scores also support its aptitude outside of gaming: the pc made quick work of the handbrake encoding test, and its photoshop time was admirable. there are systems in this price range that offer faster performance, but a certain amount of the omen x's cost can be linked to the work that goes into making it so small. still, if the size and functionality are enough to get you on board, know that it's a fast desktop, too.  powered by a gtx 1080, the omen has solid 3d and gaming scores. on the heaven and valley gaming tests at 1080p and ultra-quality settings, the omen x averaged 124 frames per second (fps) and 115fps, respectively. that's well above the target 60fps, and scales well when you bump up the resolution further. 4k is a bit of a reach, but it is capable of 30fps, averaging 30fps and 39fps on the same test at 3,840-by-2,160 resolution. again, there's the caveat that some other systems in this price range will get more power, but they're much larger, more traditional desktops. it doesn't reach quite the same highs as some of its small-form-factor competition, with the origin pc chronos, the tiki, and the corsair one pushing out higher frame rates, but there's not a big gap between the hp and these non-portable desktops.   see how we test desktops battery life isn't something we typically discuss with desktops, but given the omen x's unique portability, it's important here. the system's internal battery ran for 2 hours and 32 minutes on our rundown test, but the hot swap batteries mean it's not something you'd need to worry about. with the omen x in the backpack with a pair of batteries connected, you have theoretically unlimited play time away from the dock, so long as you keep throwing the unused pair into the charging base. if you're someone who would spend hours at a time wearing a headset, the omen x and backpack allow you to do so untethered. from full charge, the batteries died in about 45 minutes of play time while the internal battery prevented the system from shutting off. you'll have to keep an eye on battery life and swap the set somewhat often, but you do have the internal battery to fall back on, at least until you can change in the other pair. the untethered gaming experience if you're going to remove the desktop from its dock and use it with the vr backpack, there's some setup involved. you need to sit the two batteries into the holsters (after making sure they're charged), connect the headset to the ports as you would on any pc, strap on the vr backpack, toss the wires out of your way behind your back, and grab your vr controllers.  the backpack fits securely, and its 10-odd pound weight with the computer and batteries doesn't feel heavy or uncomfortable. once the battery packs are screwed into the bottom of the pc, switching batteries is a matter of pressing a button on the side of each compartment to release them and inserting charged ones that click into place. adding the headset to the mix is another story. while the backpack comes with a shortened 3-in-1 cable, hp's own windows mixed reality headset uses a proprietary connector with its much longer 2-in-1 cable. this requires using the longer cable with the backpack, because the shorter cable won't plug into the headset. the included cable could conceivably work with other vr headsets, but not hp's. once we made sure the longer cord wasn't dragging, having free movement with no cables connecting to a separate computer or console let us walk freely without tripping. we spent several hours in total strapped into the vr backpack with the omen x compact desktop locked onto it wearing the hp windows mixed reality headset, trying out titles including rick & morty: virtual rick-ality, minecraft vr, and the lego batman batmersive vr experience. of course, because windows mixed reality offers no way of seeing out of the headset's front-facing cameras, we still had to be careful and move within a certain area to avoid bumping into things. the good news is that it works exactly as intended, allowing some freedom of movement away from a stationary pc. additionally, in our testing, there was no performance drop running the system on the batteries, out of the dock, so you won't be taking a frame rate hit if you decide to step away from your seat while playing. the bad news is that it isn't any more of a compelling vr experience than traditional setups, and ultimately has most of the same limitations as a desk-bound vr solutions. you need to have a good amount of open space to get any benefit, and given that you can't see with the headset on\u2014you won't trip over any wires, but it's no use if you can't move around freely without falling over your chair or stubbing your toe\u2014movement is still pretty limited. even with two pairs of batteries, we're struggling to find a justification for the $500 price tag of the backpack. tether-free vr is a minor convenience that doesn't justify spending as much on a harness as you would on a vr headset itself. technically functional, practically questionable while the product pair succeeds in its design goal, the omen x compact desktop and vr backpack combination is a lot of (expensive) equipment with a fussy setup process for a very simple task. you have to really want to play vr, and to play it in this untraditional way, for the investment to be worthwhile. being totally freed from a desk is neat, but you still need a lot of space to store and use the system. the vr backpack also seems very redundant considering alternatives. mobile-based vr platforms like google daydream view and samsung gear vr are functional, even if they can't offer the graphical fidelity or processing power of tethered vr systems. more notably, standalone vr headsets are in production, and even htc is cutting the cable without a backpack with its upcoming vive wireless adapter. with all of these solutions, an expensive harness with a computer on your back seems a bit silly. it's not especially quick to set up, either, and you're still draped with plugs and wires when you're ready to go. add in the cost, the need to monitor your battery life, and amount of hardware you need to keep track of, and it's easy to question whether it's all worthwhile. the hp omen x compact desktop and vr backpack feels more like a novel tech demo than a truly useful innovation.   hp omen x compact desktop and vr backpack   good             at     bottom line: the hp omen x compact desktop and backpack delivers pc-based vr gaming away from your desk. a neat-sounding idea, but ultimately, it's a pricey solution to a niche problem.        desktopshp omen xhp omen x ...

pcmag asia     monitors                    asus rog swift pg258q asus rog swift pg258q the asus rog swift pg258q is a pricey 25-inch-class monitor that offers a wealth of features for gamers, including an ultra-fast refresh rate and nvidia's g-sync technology.  editor rating: excellent (4.0) jan 29, 2018      review comments specs        street price$ 559.00   prosbeastly performer, 240hz refresh rate, 1ms response timeconsstruggles with blacks, needs color calibration out of the box, expensivebottom linethis pricey monitor performs well and is meant to appeal to a select enthusiast audience and for them, it delivers the goods.  jan. 29, 2018   john r. delaney       the latest addition to the asus republic of gamers line of gaming monitors, the rog swift pg258q ($599.99), boasts some impressive specs, including a 240hz refresh rate, 1-millisecond pixel response rate, nvidia's g-sync anti-tearing technology, and a bunch of gamer-centric settings. not surprisingly, this 25-inch-class display aced our gaming tests and looks good doing so, but its 1,920-by-1,080 resolution is low for a $600 monitor, and it's a bit stingy with its i/o ports. our top pick for midsize gaming monitors, the dell 24 gaming monitor s2417dg, offers a higher 2,560-by-1,440 resolution and comes in at $30 less. design and features with its zero-bezel design and light signature custom lighting effects, there's no doubt that the pg258q is meant for gaming. the 24.5-inch panel is housed in a dark-gray cabinet with copper accents and a high-tech pattern. the 6.9-pound cabinet is supported by a three-legged stand that also has copper accents and provides the gamut of adjustment options, including tilt, swivel, height, and pivot. the cabinet can be removed from the stand and mounted on a wall using the four vesa-compliant mounting holes.  view all 5 photos in gallery    the bottom of the stand contains the light signature lamp, which projects a pattern onto your desktop surface. the monitor comes with two plastic lenses with the rog logo pattern and three blank lenses that you can use to create your own custom pattern using a marker pen. at the rear of the cabinet, on the right side, are four buttons that are used as hot keys to select a gaming preset, enable crosshair-aiming reticles, exit the menu system, and turn the monitor on and off. there's also a five-way joystick button for navigating the settings menu and selecting menu items. in addition to brightness, contrast, and gamma settings, the pg258q offers six gamevisual picture presets, including scenery, racing, cinema, real-time strategy (rts), role-playing game (rpg), and first-person shooter (fps), as well as srgb modes. it also offers the same gameplus settings that come with the asus designo curved mx34vq, including crosshair-aiming targets, a frames-per-second counter, and a game timer. you also get four low-blue-light settings, an ultra low motion blur (ulmb) setting, four color temperature settings, and a dark boost setting.  the pg258q's twisted nematic (tn) panel has a 1,920-by-1,080 resolution, which is fairly common for a panel of this size, but is relatively low compared with the 2,560-by-1,440 (wqhd) resolution of the similarly priced dell s2417dg. in addition to a 240hz refresh rate and 1-millisecond pixel response, the pg258q has a peak brightness of 400 cd/m2, a 1,000:1 native contrast ratio, and a 16:9 aspect ratio.  you don't get many i/o ports with the pg258q. it has a displayport input, an hdmi input, a usb 3.0 upstream port, two usb 3.0 downstream ports, and a headphone jack, all of which are located at the rear of the cabinet, facing downward. the dell s2417dg offers the same selection of video inputs, and gives you two additional usb 3.0 ports, which are mounted on the side of the cabinet for easy access. the pg258q is backed by a three-year warranty for parts, labor, and backlight, and ships with a quick start guide, the aforementioned lenses, a resource cd, and hdmi, displayport, and usb cables. performance when it comes to gaming performance, the pg258q comes up big. it handled fast motion in our crysis 3 (pc) and call of duty: infinite warfare (sony playstation 4) tests with aplomb, delivering smooth gaming action, with no noticeable blurring or ghosting. screen tearing was minimal, but enabling g-sync remedied that issue and made gameplay appear even smoother and more fluid. input lag, as measured with a leo bodnar video input lag tester, came in at a manageable 16.3 milliseconds. our fastest monitor, the benq sw2700pt, measured 9.5 milliseconds. see how we test monitors color accuracy in our tests was good, but not ideal. on the chromaticity chart below, our color measurements are represented by the colored dots, while the ideal cie color coordinates are represented by the boxes. as illustrated, red and blue colors are in line with their ideal coordinates, but green is outside of its box. this is fairly common with tn panels and will likely go unnoticed, as long as the monitor is not going to be used for color-critical work. there were no signs of oversaturated greens or tinting while viewing scenes from marvel's antman on blu-ray, and colors appeared uniform in the displaymate full-screen uniformity and purity tests.  grayscale performance was also good, but not quite as sharp as what you get from a good in-plane switching (ips) panel like the one used on the viewsonic vp2468. as was the case with the dell s2417dg, viewing angles were good, but not great, in our tests; side- and bottom-angle viewing was fine, but the picture became slightly washed out when viewed from a top angle. the pg258q consumed 19 watts of power in testing while set to srgb mode (it does not offer an eco power-saving mode). that's identical to the acer r240hy and a bit more energy efficient than the dell s2417dg (24 watts), the aoc g2460pf (30 watts), and the aoc g2460pg (32 watts). conclusion the asus rog swift pg258q is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a midsize monitor with serious gaming chops, but at about $600, it doesn't come cheap. however, it offers the fastest refresh rate available, as well as a speedy pixel response and nvidia's g-sync technology. moreover, it's packed with lots of neat features that will enhance your gaming experience, including gaming presets, custom lighting, crosshair-aiming overlays, low-blue-light filters, and a fully adjustable stand. that said, a few more connectivity options would be nice. if you prefer to do battle at a higher resolution, consider our editors' choice for midsize gaming monitors, the dell 24 gaming monitor s2417dg, which also costs $30 less.      monitorsasus rog swift ...       more inside

elitebook x360 2-in-1 laptop is all business inside, with an intel core i7 processor, 14-hour battery life, and a comprehensive set of security features.  jan. 19, 2018    tom brant       the hp elitebook x360 1020 g2 (starts at $1,379; $2,049 as tested) has most features that business users look for in a 2-in-1 convertible laptop. this 12.5-inch model can be used as a conventional laptop, but thanks to its 360-degree hinge and touch screen, you can also use it as a tablet or prop it up on a table like a tent to watch movies or display a presentation. a speedy intel core i7 processor and 16gb of memory complement all this versatility, and so does a unique integrated privacy filter that drastically reduces the viewing angles of the screen at the touch of a button. still, there are a few drawbacks that will tip the scales in favor of the larger and identically priced hp elitebook x360 1030 g2. hide everything with a single button press the elitebook x360 1020 is a smaller version of the aforementioned x360 1030 g2, a 13.3-inch convertible released early last year. with the exception of size, there's a lot of similarity between the two laptops. both of the models we tested have an intel core i7-7600u processor running at 2.7ghz, a 512gb ssd, and 16gb of ram. that's a high-end configuration, but these are premium laptops designed to be a road warrior's primary workhorse, not as a loaner machine that deskbound employees will occasionally check out. you can of course select cheaper components, but such stinginess won't result in a good deal, since the starting price of the 1020 g2\u2014with an intel core i5\u2014is nearly 70 percent that of our top-of-the-line review unit.  view all 7 photos in gallery    choosing between screen sizes is a slightly more difficult decision. both the 1030 g2 and the 1020 g2 cost the same ($2,049), so it initially seems like a no-brainer to go with the larger model. but the 1030 measures 0.59 by 12.5 by 8.6 inches (hwd), and weighs 2.84 pounds, compared with the 0.53 by 11.4 by 8 inches and 2.5 pounds of the 1020 g2. many travelers who fly hundreds of thousands of miles a year and give multiple presentations in different conference rooms will likely be attracted to the lighter weight and smaller size of the 1020 g2, even though it's a difference of mere ounces and tenths of an inch.  once you've made your screen size decision, you'll be pleased to know that the robust build quality and ancillary features list of the 1030 g2 largely carries over. the most eye-catching feature\u2014it's really an eye-repelling feature\u2014is the privacy filter that's integrated into the display. gone are the days when business travelers had to struggle with cumbersome 3m privacy filters whenever they used their laptops on an airplane tray table. instead, they can now simply press the f2 key on the 1020 g2 to activate sureview, which makes text on the screen virtually unreadable to people viewing it from an angle greater than about 40 degrees. knowing that your seatmate can't see your work can be very reassuring, even if you're not editing a top-secret file. still, as useful as the sureview feature is, it significantly degrades the quality of the full hd (1,920-by-1,080) screen. white window backgrounds appear grainy whether or not the filter's activated, colors are dull and washed out, and when you're using the included stylus, dark grey streaks trail the tip as you're writing or drawing.  you can mitigate this somewhat by adjusting the screen brightness (the maximum is 700 nits, which is excellent for a laptop), but you can't mitigate sureview's other problem: its effect on battery life. hp estimates that a sureview-equipped model with the filter activated will have a 37 percent shorter battery life than a model without sureview. even when the privacy filter is turned off, a sureview model still has 24 percent less battery life than the base-model 1020 g2. sure enough, our review unit clocked in at just 8 hours and 21 minutes on our battery-rundown test, and that's with sureview turned off. the 1030 g2, meanwhile, managed more than 14 hours of battery life. so if you're going to use the filter on a long flight, you'd better hope that your seat has a power supply. suffice it to say that sureview has some teething problems, but also serious benefits if you're worried about the kind of data theft that no malware protection can provide: the kind that happens when someone's looking over your shoulder. attention to detail some it departments have shrugged off hp, instead preferring venerable business laptops from dell and lenovo. but the build quality on the 1020 g2 shows that they should probably change their ways. the elitebook not only looks and feels sturdy, but there are small design cues that suggest an apple-esque attention to detail. for instance, the antennas for wi-fi and bluetooth are hidden within a thin strip on the top edge of the display lid rather than buried in the motherboard, which hp says improves range. a volume up/down rocker and a power button are located on the notebook's edges, so you can easily adjust volume or shut down the computer while in tablet mode or tent mode. and there are even must-have business features that you won't find on many consumer convertibles or any mac laptop, like a full-size hdmi port and a fingerprint reader.  unfortunately, glaring omissions include a standard usb 3.0 port and an ethernet jack, which we still expect to see on a business laptop for compatibility with older peripherals and a means of escape from unreliable wi-fi. as a consolation prize, both of the usb-c connectors\u2014located on the left edge\u2014support thunderbolt 3 and can charge the laptop using the included usb-c charging cable. hp also includes a usb-c-to-ethernet adapter, which is a nice touch. the touchpad and backlit keyboard feel sturdy, with very little keyboard flex and a generously sized, accurate, and clickable pad. other than sturdiness, perhaps the best feature of the keyboard is its dedicated skype controls, especially the button that instantly lets you mute the mic to avoid embarassing situations. there are no full-sized directional arrow keys since the fingerprint reader takes up the space that would otherwise be dedicated to them, so you'll have to make do with half-height up- and down-arrow keys. speaking of the fingerprint reader, it's one of several ways that you can log in to the 1020 g2, but it's not the fastest. that honor belongs to the webcam, which has infrared sensors that allow it to support face-recognition logins via windows hello. face detection failed only once during a week of testing in all sorts of lighting conditions and logging in and out several times a day. if it does fail, you'll be prompted to log in using your password, pin code, or fingerprint. once you're logged in, the 720p camera performs about as expected for a front-facing webcam\u2014that is, it offers vaguely grainy videos that are nevertheless perfectly acceptable for business videoconferencing. the stereo speakers are loud, certainly loud enough to fill a hotel room, and they offer suprisingly robust lows when you account for how thin the 1020 g2 is. that's no doubt due to their bang & olufsen pedigree. hp includes a generous three-year warranty on parts and labor with this configuration of the 1020 g2, although other models have a one-year warranty. familiar components as mentioned earlier, our review unit is equipped with components that should be extremely familiar to people responsible for making purchase decisions on high-end business laptops: an intel core i7-7600u processor running at 2.8ghz, a 512gb ssd, and 16gb of ram. it's easy to find laptops and convertibles with this configuration for about $2,000, and we've included a few that we really like (including the 1030 g2 and the spectre x360 13), as well as ones that are good but unremarkable, like the dell latitude 7389, in our performance comparison.  see how we test laptops this mashup tells a predictable story: each of the machines offers more than adequate processing power for videoconferencing, web browsing, and other tasks that business users are likely to perform on a daily basis. with a score of 3,454 on the pcmark 8 benchmark, a synthetic test that approximates these types of tasks, the 1020 g2 is at the top of a very narrow range. it's the same with our real-world tests. the 1020 g2 took 3 minutes and 19 seconds to complete our list of image-editing tasks in adobe photoshop, which is exactly how long the latitude 7389 took and just 3 seconds slower than the 1030 g2.  scores were equally lumped together on our graphics performance tests. the results\u2014including frame rates in the single digits on our heaven and valley gaming benchmarks\u2014indicate that the 1020 g2 isn't a good choice for playing aaa titles at maximum quality and full resolution, although you might be able to relax at the end of a long work day with a less-demanding game at medium-quality settings. these results aren't surprising, since all of the machines here use integrated graphics.  when privacy matters with scores this similar, it managers should really be basing purchase decisions on ancillary features rather than computing performance. indeed, it is with those ancillary features that the hp elitebook 1020 g2 shines or falls flat, depending on your needs. if you're looking for a powerful, long-lasting convertible with a comfortably sized screen, the 1030 g2 is the clear winner and remains our editors' choice, since it offers longer battery life and a larger screen for the same price as its smaller counterpart. on the other hand, the sureview privacy filter on the 1020 g2 could be worth the battery life sacrifice for the peace of mind that it offers in certain scenarios, especially for employees who are constantly traveling.   hp elitebook x360 1020 g2   good             at     bottom line: a diminutive convertible laptop with a unique integrated privacy filter, the hp x360 1020 g2 is an intriguing choice for road warriors,

jan. 10, 2018   jim fisher       casual snapshooters and family documentarians take note: the canon eos m100 ($599 with 15-45mm lens) is a mirrorless camera that gets a lot right. it corrects the missteps that canon made with its first mirrorless releases, delivering speedy autofocus and solid image quality. its one of the smaller mirrorless models on the market, and has a big touch lcd that will appeal to smartphone photographers. it's not our absolute favorite affordable mirrorless option\u2014that's the sony a6000\u2014but it's a fine alternative for casual shooters who don't mind the absence of an evf. design the m100 is one of the smaller mirrorless cameras out there. it measures 2.6 by 4.3 by 1.4 inches (hwd) without a lens and weighs about 10.7 ounces. the included 15-45mm zoom is well matched, coming in at 1.8 by 2.4 inches (hd) and adding just 4.6 ounces. the entire package weighs less than a pound and, while it won't fit in your pocket, it also won't take up that much room in a bag.   view all 30 photos in gallery    you can get the m100 in black or white. the black version ships with a matching lens, while the white body is paired with a silver lens. the 15-45mm is a collapsible design, about an inch shorter when retracted than when extended and ready to shoot. you'll have to fiddle with a lock-and-twist mechanism to extend it, which can be an inconvenience. but it's something you'll get used to pretty quickly. canon keeps it minimal when it comes to on-body controls. if you're serious about photography and want functions at your fingertips, the pricier eos m5 is a better fit within the eos m system. it also includes a hot shoe and integrated evf, two premium features missing from the m100. the top plate houses the pop-up flash\u2014it hides within the body when not in use\u2014as well as the integrated power button and mode switch, the shutter release and control dial, and the record button. the mode switch only has three positions\u2014scene intelligent auto is marked by a green a and puts the m100 in complete control over exposure and focus. a middle option, marked by a still camera icon, is there if you want to adjust settings; it gives access to program, shutter priority, aperture priority, and manual shooting modes. the final position is indicated by a movie camera icon and switches things over for video recording. you can start and stop a movie from any mode, however, using the record button.  rear controls are nestled in the bottom right corner, to the right of the lcd and below the thumb rest. you get menu, play, and wi-fi buttons, as well as a four-way control pad with q/set at its center and ae-l, ev, flash, and info mapped to its directional presses. on-screen controls supplement the limited physical control buttons. tap q and an overlay menu appears to adjust focus, drive, metering, image quality, and other commonly adjusted settings via touch. you can also tap the screen to set the focus point or identify a subject for tracking. the lcd itself is 3 inches in size, packing 1,040k dots into its frame. it's bright and sharp, which is important as it's the only tool you have to frame and review shots. it's also mounted on a hinge. it's the style that can flip up and face all the way forward, so you can shoot selfies just as easily as shots from the hip. but it doesn't tilt down, so if you want to frame a shot with the camera over your head, you'll have to resort to holding the contraption upside-down. physical connections include micro hdmi and mini usb ports, and an sd card slot, all on the left side of the body. the battery lives by itself, accessible via a bottom door, and is rated for 295 images or 80 minutes of video per cipa standards. the m100 does not support in-camera charging, so you'll need to replenish it using the included wall charger. it's compact and has a folding, integrated plug. lenses the canon eos m system isn't as well established as other mirrorless systems, so it's important to consider what lenses are available. the included ef-m 15-45mm covers a solid range, wide angle to short telephoto, but at a narrow aperture. canon also sells a compact telezoom, the 55-200mm f/4.5-6.3 is stm, and an ultra-wide zoom, the ef-m 11-22mm f/4-5.6 is stm. the lenses are all quite small, and match well with the m100 body, but none are ideal for shooting in dim conditions.  there is one wide aperture prime, the ef-m 22mm f/2, which is small, sharp, and bright\u2014it's the one you want for blurring backgrounds and shooting in tough light. canon also has the ef-m 28mm f/3.5 macro for close-up shots. an all-in-one 18-150mm zoom and an 18-55mm round out the available glass. that's a pretty paltry selection when compared with what you can get for a fujifilm, micro four thirds, or sony mirrorless camera. yes, you can use canon slr lenses via an adapter, but doing so makes the m100 a larger camera.  canon's approach to its mirrorless lens line has some drawbacks\u2014you don't see any wide aperture zooms, and just a couple of prime lenses. on the other hand, canon has kept the size down to a reasonable level for every lens release to this point. the lack of pro-grade options isn't a big deal for most shoppers in the market for an entry-level camera. but if you want high-end lenses, another system is probably a better way to go. connectivity the m100 has the standard cocktail of wireless protocols built-in, with support for bluetooth, nfc, and wi-fi. bluetooth is used to set the time and date, speed up the wi-fi connection process, and allows your phone to serve as a basic remote shutter release (without live view). nfc is included to automate pairing with android devices.  for everything else\u2014file transfer, geotagging, and full remote control\u2014you'll need to connect your phone to the m100's wi-fi network. it's an easy step, and everything works well. transfers are speedy and remote control works as expected, with exposure adjustments available if the camera is set to a mode that supports them. i would have liked to see bluetooth file transfers available as an option, as it is with nikon snapbridge cameras. we'll see if canon adds that feature in future models. performance early canon mirrorless cameras were plagued by slow autofocus. that's been fixed. the m100 locks focus in about 0.05-second in bright light and 0.7-second in very dim conditions. there's a bit of a lag starting up\u2014the camera requires 1.3 seconds to power on, focus, and fire\u2014but that's not an obscene figure for a mirrorless model. others, like the olympus pen e-pl8, are quicker, but only by about a half-second.  burst shooting is available at 6.2fps. the m100 keeps that pace for 20 raw or raw+jpg shots, or 100 jpgs. the buffer clears to a sandisk 95mbps memory card quickly, in 8 seconds or less depending on the format.  see how we test digital cameras the 6.2fps speed is with focus locked. if you enable continuous focus\u2014canon calls it ai servo\u2014the speed slows to 3.8fps. the drop in speed is because the camera is adjusting focus between every image. the m100 did well in our moving target test, getting almost every shot in crisp focus.  there are a few different focus area options available. you can let the camera pick a focus point, tapping on the rear screen to identify subjects for tracking. this is a good option for photographing people, as the m100 supports face detection. you can also opt to select a focus point, tapping on the screen to change its position, if you want more control over where the m100 focuses. image and video quality the m100 uses the same 24mp aps-c image sensor we've seen in other canon slrs and mirrorless cameras, dating back to the 80d. it's a good sensor, with on-sensor phase focus (canon calls it dual pixel af), which is why the m100 focuses faster than older models. and because we've seen the sensor before, we know how the m100 should perform, and it meets those expectations. when shooting jpg images noise is kept under 1.5 percent through iso 3200, and increases to just 1.6 percent at iso 6400. cameras apply noise reduction to remove grain from jpg images, and the m100 is no exception. the iso will range upward in dim light, especially with the kit lens, but it can go all the way to iso 1600 without sacrificing image quality. at iso 3200, a setting the camera is likely to use in moderately lit interiors along with the kit lens, there is some smudging of fine lines. smudging is slightly more noticeable at iso 6400, which is how far the camera needs to go for more dimly lit home interiors.  beyond that, at iso 12800 and 25600, the image output is a bit blurred. it's advisable to use the pop-up flash in really dark situations, or add the 22mm f/2 lens to your kit. if you're a fan of shooting in bars or a foodie who likes to snap shots in restaurants, it's a worthy add-on to step up image quality. if you move past shooting in jpg format, you'll be happy to know that raw format is also available. raw images can be edited more flexibly, more than what a simple instagram filter can manage, but do require you to spend time editing photos, and invest in software to do the job. to give you an idea about how much you can do with a raw image, take a look at the comparison below, with an out-of-camera jpg at the left and a processed raw image at the right.  for lab tests, i converted our raw shots using adobe lightroom classic cc with default develop settings enabled. raw images do a fine job preserving detail through iso 6400, without looking too grainy. at iso 12800 grain is strong, but it's not blurry like a jpg. the top iso setting, 25600, is a bit much for the m100, even in raw format. we've seen competing cameras with 24mp sony-made sensors, like the nikon d3400 and sony's own a6300, net images at iso 25600 that are as good as the m100's iso 12800 output. you aren't getting a class-leading sensor here, but you are getting a very good, capable one. video quality is good, although you're limited to 1080p\u2014there's no 4k option. you can shoot at 24, 30, or 60fps, giving you the option of the cinematic aesthetic (24fps), traditional video (30fps), or a high-speed look (60fps). there's also a time-lapse option. the camera does a good job with autofocus when recording, and the internal mic picks up voices clearly, as long as they're fairly close to the camera. but it also picks up background noise, and there's now way to use an external mic. in short, the m100 is a solid choice for casual video clips, but don't expect to use it for anything more serious. conclusions canon has done a good job with the eos m100. it doesn't sacrifice any image quality or focus speed compared with the higher-end models in the line. instead, it focuses on making things easy and making the camera portable enough so that you won't mind taking it with you to events or on vacation.  the m100's strengths as an entry-level model do point out some of the shortcomings of the eos m system for more serious photographers. canon's decision to keep lenses small means that apertures are narrow. if you want f/1.4 primes or f/2.8 zooms, you need to adapt slr lenses. if you want a system you can grow with as your interest in photography matures, there are better options. but for families and casual snappers who want slr image quality, without the bulk, the eos m100 is an excellent way to go. it focuses quickly, has a brisk burst shooting rate, and has wi-fi so you can beam images to your phone. it doesn't quite earn editors' choice marks\u2014that stays with the sony a6000, a more robust mirrorless camera with 11.1fps burst shooting and an integrated evf. the sony is a better choice if you love photography; the m100 is for folks who don't give a lick about f-stops and iso settings, but want a camera that preserves family memories in ways that smartphones can't manage.   canon eos m100   excellent             at     bottom line: the mirrorless canon eos m100 delivers slr image quality and fast autofocus in a compact build with a touch lcd that makes it easy for anyone to use.        canon eos m100

sexual harassment is facing questions  by          michael kan       oct. 26, 2018, 9:15 a.m.  the new york times published a story that suggests google has been protecting senior executives accused of sexual harassment. however, google's ceo said his company is taking a harder line against all employees found engaging in sexual misconduct.       is google taking workplace sexual harassment seriously? on thursday, the new york times published a story that claims google paid $90 million to android founder andy rubin in his exit package \u2014 even though he was forced to resign in 2014 over a credible sexual misconduct claim. the report goes on to paint a picture of google protecting senior executives accused of sexual harassment. amit singhal, a former head of google search, also received an exit package paid in the millions after he resigned over allegations he groped an employee. google isn't denying all the claims in the report. on thursday, company ceo sundar pichai and company vice president eileen naughton sent out an email to staffers that says: \"today's story in the new york times was difficult to read.\" however, pichai and naughton were quick to add that google \"is dead serious\" about making the company a \"safe and inclusive workplace.\" the email \u2014 which pcmag obtained through a company spokesperson \u2014 gives a rundown of google's recent efforts to stop sexual misconduct. it notes that during the past two years, google has terminated 48 employees for sexual harassment. 13 of the employees were senior managers or above, and none of them received an exit package. \"we want to assure you that we review every single complaint about sexual harassment or inappropriate conduct, we investigate and we take action,\" reads the email. an updated google policy also demands that company vice presidents and senior vice presidents disclose relationships with co-workers, regardless of \"reporting line or presence of conflict.\" that all said, the email makes no mention of singhal and rubin, both of whom left google over two years ago. the new york times' report suggests google paid rubin the huge exit package to prevent him working at a competitor and disparaging the company through a wrongful termination suit. sam singer, a spokesman for rubin, told the new york times that the android founder left google on his own accord and that he did not engage in sexual misconduct while employed at the company.        next article    more inside pcmag.com rockstar strongly recommends red dead redemption 2 launch patch china: to avoid

(photo by win mcnamee/getty images) china and russia are reportedly listening to donald trump's phone calls, but china has a \"solution\": buy a secure phone from chinese handset maker huawei. china's foreign ministry made the suggestion on thursday, hours after the new york times reported that chinese and russian intelligence agencies have been intercepting calls trump is making on insecure iphones. during the daily press briefing, foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying dismissed the report as \"fake news\" and mocked the whole situation by bringing up huawei, which the us has repeatedly accused of state-sponsored spying. \"if they are worried that their iphones may be eavesdropped, they might want to use the mobile phones produced by huawei,\" hua said at the briefing. \"if they are still not reassured, for the sake of absolute security, they may stop using all modern communications devices and cut themselves off from the outside world.\"    hua's comments come after verizon and at&t dropped plans to sell a new huawei handset amidst reported pressure from us government officials. the main concern is that china will secretly compel huawei to spy on americans through its electronics products. huawei has repeatedly denied ever engaging in state-sponsored espionage, and even tried to play up the security of its smartphones. nevertheless, switching from an iphone to a huawei handset probably wouldn't have stopped the phone tapping documented by times. the newspaper's report doesn't explicitly detail how china and russia have been allegedly spying on trump; it merely says the his calls have been intercepted as they travel through \"cell tower, cables, and switches that make up national and international cellphone networks.\" that's prompted speculation that the alleged spying may be occurring through a vulnerability in the telecommunication infrastructure that's been known for years. the flaw involves a legacy protocol called signaling system seven or ss7, which was designed to efficiently route telephone calls. carriers across the world use the technology to link their networks together, but unfortunately the ss7 protocol can also be exploited by spy agencies to tap phone calls, collect text messages, and track people's locations. ss7 protocol trusts all traffic sent over the network, so anyone with access to the system can manipulate the signaling information. when ss7 first emerged four decades ago, only a few carriers were in control of the protocol, but now thousands of companies are part of the ss7 ecosystem\u2014some of which can even sell that access. in china, the government owns all three telecommunication carriers. trump, of course, has access to secure lines inside the white house, but the crux of the times story is that he uses cell phones so he can chat with long-time friends without having to alert staff about who he's talking to. on twitter today, trump said \"i rarely use a cellphone and when i do it's government authorized. i like hard lines,\" he wrote. astute tweeters, however, noted that the message was sent from an iphone.      next article    more inside pcmag.com

birthdates, phone numbers, email and physical addresses, passport numbers, identity card numbers, frequent flyer numbers, customer service remarks, and historical travel information.       a major data breach has put the personal information of 9.4 million cathay pacific customers at risk. on wednesday, the hong kong-based airline revealed that someone without authorization broke into its information system and accessed passengers' names, nationalities, birthdates, phone numbers, email and physical addresses, passport numbers, identity card numbers, frequent flyer numbers, customer service remarks, and historical travel information. among the cache of potentially stolen data was also some financial information, including more than 400 expired credit card numbers and 27 credit card numbers without associated cvv codes. cathay pacific said it has no evidence at this time that any of that data has been misused. the company added that its breached it systems are \"totally separate\" from its flight operations systems, so \"there is no impact on flight safety.\" \"we are very sorry for any concern this data security event may cause our passengers,\" cathay pacific chief executive officer rupert hogg said in a statement. \"we acted immediately to contain the event, commence a thorough investigation with the assistance of a leading cybersecurity firm, and to further strengthen our it security measures.\" cathay pacific discovered the intrusion during its \"ongoing it security processes,\" but did not specify when the incident occurred or when it found out about it. the company has already notified authorities and is now in the process of informing affected passengers. it says that the \"combination of data accessed varies for each affected passenger\" though \"no-one's travel or loyalty profile was accessed in full, and no passwords were compromised.\" as is customary after incidents like this, cathay pacific is offering affected customers free id

robots work together to open a door  by          matthew humphries       oct. 26, 2018, 12:24 a.m.  micro robots that can work together, pull objects 40-times their own weight, and anchor themselves to surfaces using tech inspired by nature might sound futuristic, but they already exist and are called flycrotugs.       it's always incredible to see just how much weight insects can carry, or how they work together to overcome problems and obstacles. now that same team effort is being applied to tiny robots, and it's allowing them to achieve tasks you'd think were impossible, for example, opening a heavy door. a team from stanford university and \u00e9cole polytechnique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de lausanne in switzerland, have created flycrotugs. they are tiny flying robots capable of anchoring themselves to a surface and using a strong winch and cable to move objects by pulling them. everything about the way flycrotugs work is inspired by nature, and in particular insects and geckos. if secure anchoring is required on a smooth surface, the robots are equipped with gecko grippers which use a non-sticky adhesive inspired by gecko feet. rough surfaces require a different approach and anchoring relies on microspines, which grip on to the smallest of pits in a surface just like fishhooks.  figuring out whether to carry or drag objects, and the trade off between fast movement, high maneuverability, and limited size was all done by looking at how wasps work. they are naturally small and strong intelligent flying objects, and they also decide whether to carry or drag their prey based on weight. once securely in position, the flycrotugs are capable of pulling objects up to 40-times their own weight. this means they could be used in a disaster situation to great effect. for example, flying in to a destroyed building, locating a survivor trapped under some rubble, and being able to lift the heavy object trapping them to allow for an escape. as the video above shows, the robots can also work together to perform otherwise insurmountable tasks. opening a heavy door requires two flycrotugs, one attaches a hook and cable to the base of the door and reverses to begin pulling. the other hooks on to the door handle, anchors at the base of the door, and uses its cable to pull down to ensure the door is off the latch. in just a few minutes the door is open. according to matthew estrada, a stanford graduate and lead author on the flycrotugs paper, this is just the beginning. work is already underway to figure out how to get several of these micro robots flying around together and working completely autonomously.        next article    more inside pcmag.com rockstar strongly recommends red dead redemption 2 launch patch google's stance on

 editor rating: good (3.0) oct 26, 2018      review comments specs            us street price$19.00   proseasy to use.  handles credit memos.  easy to customize invoices.  able to tell when invoice has been opened by customer.consvery limited features at lowest price tier.  more expensive transaction fees at lower pricing tiers.  no ocr on receipt images.  billed yearly rather than per month.  lots of feature variance between different pricing tiers.bottom lineinvoice2go is a solid billing and invoicing app with good mobile support and a decent feature set, as long as you're willing to pay for a higher pricing tier as well as pay annually.  oct. 26, 2018   ted needleman       invoice2go (which begins at $19 per year) has just about all of the billing and invoicing software functionality your business needs. it prices just right for small to midsize businesses (smbs), but it is easy enough to use for users of all skill levels. with that in mind, though, it is limited in some respects. for example, you can only send 50 invoices per year, and you can only send those invoices to five different clients under the starter plan. despite being easy to use, it still lags behind editors' choice winners wave and zoho invoice in our billing and invoicing software review roundup. low-cost limitations invoice2go's lowest-priced plan also doesn't let you generate estimates, so it may not work if that is a necessary part of your business. on the plus side, you still get an attractive invoice design that can be customized, and are able to accept debit and credit card payments. similar to the pricing structure in and co, the fees for this service are different at the different plan levels. at the starter plan level, it's 3.4 percent and 30 cents per transaction, but that drops down to 2.9 percent and 30 cents per transaction if you have the unlimited plan. invoices2go uses stripe as its credit card processing service, and those are their charges. stripe also lets you accept american express, mastercard, and visa, as well as paypal. other plans provide more invoices, clients, and features. i reviewed the most expensive unlimited plan, which costs $33.99 per month (billed annually). this plan doesn't limit invoices, estimates, or clients, and can be used by five different users. it also provides the most features of any of the available plans (there are two other plans priced between the starter and the unlimited plans. and in case your business has you moving around a lot, invoice2go is designed to run very nicely on a smartphone, plus there are separate applications for android and ios as well as a browser-based user interface (ui), which is how i tested the software.  easy navigation a side benefit of invoice2go's mobile focus is an easy-to-navigate ui across all of its iterations. unlike tools such as freshbooks, signing into invoice2go does not bring you to a dashboard, which is a more common approach among the invoicing apps i reviewed. rather, invoice2go drops you on a screen that shows the amount of unpaid invoices, overdue invoices, a list of each invoice the system has generated going back to the first one, and any recently edited invoices. there's a figure for total sales for the month, a \"create\" button in the upper right corner, and a vertical menu running along the left side of the screen. there's a link on the bottom right that says \"view more sales data,\" which will take you to the dashboard. this dashboard summarizes the sales by month or by quarter, and also shows sales by client for the top five clients. you can expand this into a report that breaks out year-to-date sales for every active client and shows all tax collected as well. it's not quite as useful as the sales tax report in some of the other apps reviewed, notably intuit quickbooks self-employed, but it can be useful in reconciling sales tax against filed reports. the create button on the home screen provides a drop-down menu that almost mirrors the one on the left side of the screen. menu options include creating and editing invoices, estimates, credit memos, purchase orders, and creating and editing clients and items. invoice2go has excellent editing and customizing capabilities for making invoices look just the way you want them. there are eight different invoice templates and you can add logos and change fonts. these customizations are accomplished in the settings menu choice. you can also edit taxes and rates in the setting menu or by editing an invoice. adding line items to an invoice is simple, and you can add new clients and items on the fly. these items can be objects, services, or expenses, and invoice2go lets you enter per-item values and costs as well as hourly rates for services. the expense menu choice lets you bill a customer for expenses you've incurred on their behalf and you can attach an image of an expense receipt if needed, though the app doesn't perform optical character recognition (ocr) to extract data from such an image, which was disappointing since that's easy to do nowadays. still, you can access the expense item list through both the expense and purchase order choices on the main menu, and once an expense item is created, it can be used with any client.  worth the money? many of the invoicing apps i looked at are either subsets of more sophisticated accounting systems, or endeavor to provide some basic accounting function beyond simply sending invoices and receiving payments. invoice2go falls squarely into that segment. it does a good job of providing basic billing and payment capabilities, but also tries to give a user some understanding of how the business is doing. at the same time, it's pretty far from a complete accounting system, nor does it try to be, which means you'll still need a small business accounting app in the long run. keep in mind that, while simple, invoice2go also isn't quite as visually fancy as some others i tested, such as wave or xero. it doesn't have a lot of graphs, and the reports are rather plain in appearance. most users will find that, at the most basic tier, they might well be better off with a free version of another vendor's offerings.  one thing to be aware of is that what you get as far as features and capabilities varies greatly between the different plans. for example, you don't get the ability to do estimates with the most basic starter plan nor do you get phone support (though you do get online support), invoice status tracking, customer statements, expense tracking, and a number of other capabilities and benefits. these start to kick in at the pro plan level, and most users will probably want to start with that plan and upgrade if and when needed. invoice2go offers a 14-day free trial, so you can get an idea of how the app works and see if you feel comfortable with it. there's no one invoicing app that's going to be a perfect fit for every business. and while the unlimited version of invoice2go that i reviewed can support up to 20 users, in reality, if you have more than half a dozen users, then you'll probably want to look at one of the other vendor's offerings that provide more features. invoice2go can generate recurring invoices at the unlimited plan level, but other vendors can give you this capability at a lower price. only the most basic users will find the starter plan attractive. but when you get to the next tier of plans, the pro plan, this one will meet the needs of a lot of self-employed business owners.   invoice2go   good

currency support functionality.  editor rating: good (3.5) oct 25, 2018      review comments specs            us street price$30.00   prosfirst paid tier ($9.99 per month) offers very good functionality.  multi-country and multi-currency capability.  excellent reporting features.  excellent export capabilities.consfree plan does not allow custom branding.  even in paid plans, only minimal invoice customization available.  time and mileage tracking are only data entry screens.bottom lineinvoicely is a solid billing and invoicing entry with good reporting and multi-currency support, though it lags a little in customization as well as time and mileage tracking.  oct. 25, 2018   ted needleman       invoicely (which begins with a free version) is a solid billing and invoicing software platform. it offers a wealth of different pricing options and just about all of the features you'd expect of a tool in this category. it supports multi-currency usage and exceptional report capabilities. it may come up short when compared to editors' choice winners wave and zoho invoice, but it's still worth considering. pricing plan breakdown moving up to the basic plan removes the 10-item-saved limitation, allows two users to generate invoices and perform other operations, and adds the ability to track bills, prepare estimates, track time and expenses, generate recurring statements, removes the invoicely branding, and accepts online payments. online payments are handled either through paypal or stripe in the united states, though other countries may have other payment systems available. invoicely is truly multinational, and you can specify the country in which you're operating as well as the chief currency to be used. in the us, stripe acts as a credit card processing service and also lets you accept automated clearing house (ach) payments. it charges 2.9 percent and 30 cents per transaction for credit or debit card charges, and 0.8 percent on ach transfers with a $5 cap on the charge. the other two payment plans, professional and enterprise, provide a custom domain for your business that extends to in-app emails. and aside from both supporting electronic payments, they also expand the number of users who can be on the system to 10 and 25 \"team members,\" respectively. i was provided with access to a professional plan account for my testing.  a dashboard-centric interface launching invoicely brings you to a dashboard landing page. this page displays an overview of your company status, including invoice status (paid, unpaid, overdue), number of customers, amount invoiced and received over a period of time you can set, and graphs of an invoice summary and income and expenses. also on the dashboard landing page is the main menu, which runs vertically along the left-hand edge of the screen. this menu offers users the option to run reports, create estimates and invoices, manage clients, enter bills, and track time spent on tasks, enter expenses, and track mileage. unfortunately, unlike intuit quickbooks self-employed, the mileage tracker doesn't actually use gps to follow you along a trip, but simply lets you enter mileage readings, rate, and a reason for the trip. likewise, the time tracking facility isn't a timer that you can start and stop when performing a task, but simply a way to enter tasks that are billed on an hourly or daily basis.  a nice touch is that you can reach your favorite input and data screens in several ways. there's the obvious one\u2014the vertical menu located on the landing screen dashboard. but you can also flip to the appropriate screens by clicking within the key performance indicators (kpi) in the dashboard. for example, clicking on an entry in the recent activities pane will bring up the screen that created that activity, such as creating an invoice. clicking on the accounts receivable pane brings up the report generation window so you can run off an accounts receivable report. one report that's missing is a sales tax report, such as the one that quickbooks self-employed provides. but even though the report is missing, it's not difficult to set up sales or other taxes in invoicely. and if you live in an area (or country) that has multiple layers of different taxes that have to be applied on your invoices, it's not difficult to set this up, either. you can also set up discount rates and default shipping rates from the settings menu option. these are good features, but i would have liked to have seen invoicely integrate with a sales tax calculation service, such as avalera, although in its lack of this feature, it's like many of the other invoicing apps i reviewed.  decent help and overall ease of use invoicely does have some fairly decent help, though it is not context-sensitive. the help button is at the bottom of the vertical menu bar, and when clicked takes you to a screen that lists the most commonly used setup options and tasks. clicking one of these brings up a screen that goes into more detail on the task with illustrations and screen shots to help you along. if this facility doesn't answer your questions, you are instructed to send an email to support. there's where it gets tricky, though. since the vendor is located in austria, don't count on getting a real-time answer, though they actually answered my single question within a few hours. for the most part, my questions were amply addressed by the in-app help system. the only question i had was whether ios and android apps were available, since i didn't see either in the respective app store. they aren't, but invoicely is entirely browser-based, so you can access it that way on any smart device as long as it's got web connectivity and a respectable browser. accessing invoicely using firefox on my iphone, i found the screen resizes to fit the device and the app is nicely useable even without a dedicated app.  overall, i found invoicely noticeably easy to use. the options are obvious, and i liked the way that you could set parameters in the reports menu. invoicely also has excellent export options. you can export any of the reports, invoices, and estimates as pdf, xls, or csv files. on the other hand, there's nothing about invoicely that makes it stand out among the crowded invoicing app field like the way freshbooks stands out with its proposal capability or and co differentiates itself with its contract feature. still, for many users with mostly basic requirements, invoicely will remain an attractive and affordable option.   invoicely   good             at     bottom line: invoicely is a strong contender in the billing space. it is lacking customization features, but it has strong reporting and currency support

relatively expensive and many features aren't available in the mobile apps.  editor rating: excellent (4.0) oct 25, 2018      review comments specs            us street price$120.00   prosmost

tools.  dozens of report templates.  enhanced mobile app.consuser interface still looks dated.  tools don't co-exist smoothly.  can't access all data remotely.bottom lineno other personal financial management application offers the depth and breadth of tools found in quicken, but its very completeness can be overwhelming.  oct. 25, 2018   kathy yakal          quicken, after 25 years of existence, has finally launched something that users have wanted in the personal finance app for a long time: a companion website that mirrors the features and information found in the desktop version. now, you can work on much of your quicken data in a web browser, from anywhere, since the data is stored in the cloud and syncs with your desktop file. the new web access capabilities also take away some of quicken's intimidation factor and makes it more competitive with state-of-the-art personal finance websites. as a result, quicken is the editors' choice for paid personal finance services. the new virtual tools are available for all versions of quicken 2018 and 2019, which is a major improvement. as quicken has matured over the years, it's become so feature-heavy and slow on older pcs (though the 2019 version offers many performance improvements) that it's just too much for some users\u2014and too expensive. but there's no denying that it's the most feature-rich personal finance application available today. versions and pricing there are four versions of quicken 2019. all let you download transactions so that you can get a comprehensive view of your finances through a variety of lenses. you can simply track your income and expenses, create budgets, and run reports in the most junior version. if you want to view and manage your investments, track your property and debt, pay bills online, and do long-term planning, you'll find tools for those actions in the more advanced plans. quicken's newest tools\u2014especially the companion website\u2014offer a state-of-the-art user experience, but make older features look dated by comparison.  view all 8 photos in gallery    quicken launched a membership program with its 2018 version. instead of paying for the application upfront, you now pay for a one- or two-year membership and receive upgrades as long as you maintain your subscription. quicken starter ($34.99 per year) is best for consumers who just want to connect to their online financial accounts and track income and expenses, monthly budgets, bills, reports, calendars, and alerts. the version tested here, quicken deluxe ($49.99), adds sophisticated investment tracking. quicken premier ($74.99 per year) offers quicken billpay and priority access to customer support. quicken home & business ($99.99 per year) allows you to track business data as well as personal income and expenses. the competition has grown steadily, though, as you can see from our reviews of rival personal finance web services, such as credit karma, nerdwallet, and mint, the editors' choice for free personal finance services. with those services, you can get a lot of good personal finance functionality for little or no monthly cost and have anytime, anywhere access.  some setup required quicken 2019 comes ready to use, but there are some setup chores you should do to make it work the way you want. open the edit menu in the windows toolbar, select preferences, and choose from options related to program functions like navigation, the register display, and downloaded transactions. of course, you'll need to connect your online accounts if you want quicken to import cleared transactions from your financial institutions. the software supports spending and saving, property and assets, investing and retirement, and debt accounts. you usually just supply the user name and password that you use to log in to these online accounts to set up the connection. mint and other competitors work similarly. quicken looks and works much like it did previously, though, as noted earlier, its performance has improved. the home page is designed to give you a thorough overview of your finances. the left vertical pane displays all of your accounts: banking, investing, property & debt, planning, and tax. clicking on any of these takes you to a more detailed view. your net worth appears at the bottom of the pane, as well as a link to your credit score. to get your credit score, you must sign up for quicken's free service. unfortunately, quicken's free credit score is only updated quarterly, as opposed to credit karma's weekly updates. the home page is highly customizable. you can choose from numerous types of tables, charts, and other graphical content to display there. you could, for example, choose a calendar that shows what happens every day, such as expected income and upcoming expenses or overdue transactions. there are lists of bill and income reminders, graphs illustrating total spending by category, asset allocation charts, and budget adherence reports. you can also save multiple views containing different groupings of content.  comprehensive coverage in quicken quicken has for many years included some tools that many people will never use, such as long-term planning tools and the more sophisticated investment- and property/debt-tracking features. but they're there and stay out of your way when you don't need them. if you're not familiar with quicken, you should click through the program tabs (such as investing and property & debt) at some point, as you might find something you'd like to explore. but the sheer volume of tools available can be overwhelming. no one else comes close to providing such a wealth of guidance and tracking tools in either a software or web-based application. take the planning interface, for example. budgets is likely the most used tool in this section. here, quicken deluxe lets you create multiple budgets based on categories you choose. you can view your progress in an easy-to-understand graphical format. other features in this section help you reduce debt, make a lifetime plan, track and project income taxes, and establish savings goals. these interactive tools combine fill-in-the-blank fields, sophisticated calculators, and reports. they then feed your responses back to you as graphs and tables. if you have an investment portfolio, you can track prices during the market day; see detailed views of individual securities; monitor and change your asset allocation; and estimate capital gains. property owners (vehicle, home, or other assets) can use a wizard to create accounts for assets and track their progress toward ownership. if you have enough financial resources that you'd make use of all of quicken's personal finance tools, you'll be spending a lot of time keeping the software current. such compliance can result in meaningful feedback and guidance from quicken, but it takes constant commitment. it's not something you can do half-heartedly. a financial professional can run similar numbers for you and can go a step further using more sophisticated tools, offering expert, personalized advice that quicken can't. it depends on how diligent you want to be and your confidence level.  spending and income from its earliest days, quicken has focused on personal income and spending. if you only use the software to track your money (including investments) and don't access its longer-term planning and tracking tools, it's worth the few dollars per month that you pay in subscription fees for quicken deluxe as opposed to starter. click the spending tab, and you arrive at a big, colorful chart that illustrates your spending by category over the last 30 days. you can modify this date range to cover alternate periods and view the graphic by individual or all accounts. below that is a register containing transactions that have been imported from your financial institutions or entered manually. you can toggle this register to reflect either income or spending and access tools that let you really micromanage your transactions. the transaction options include splitting them; adding notes, flags, and attachments; changing categories; and assigning tax lines. accurate categorization of your transactions is very important. it makes your reports more useful and your taxes correct should you use quicken data to help prepare your income taxes. the bills and income tab deals primarily with your incoming bills. you can enter each manually or connect to online billers where you have accounts to download the pertinent details, and view the list by biller name, due date, or as a graphical calendar. once a bill has been added, you can edit it (once or for all future occurrences), mark it as paid, and enter it as a transaction in the appropriate register. income is also addressed in this section of quicken, which is puzzling at first. i would have expected to see it grouped with spending. but the logic becomes clear after you see that not only can you track your income in multiple views, but you can also see a chart that projects your account balances based on upcoming bills and income. what you can't do, though, is actually pay bills electronically in quicken deluxe. you'd need one of the two more expensive subscriptions for that. you can, of course, print checks. excellent support quicken has a learning curve. it takes some time to simply learn what it can do and how each area of the software integrates with the others. but you don't have to explore everything. quicken has a huge range of capabilities that have been added on over the years; you can either use or ignore them. if you do choose to tackle the more sophisticated features, there's plenty of support available. there are written guides and videos, an active online community, and faqs. you can also chat with a support agent 24/7 or call one monday to friday from 5 a.m.-5 p.m. pacific time.  accessing quicken remotely as robust as quicken is, you wouldn't expect to be able to access the lion's share of its features remotely. and you can't. ios apps and android apps are available. these apps include the tools and data you most likely need when you're away from your computer. you can view and add account registers and transactions and see charts illustrating your spending categories and overall spending and income. your investment portfolio is even available, albeit not with all the complex desktop-based tools. as mentioned earlier, the new browser-based companion to desktop quicken (app.quicken.com) takes some of the intimidation factor out of the software for individuals who aren't power users (though those people would likely find it helpful, too). the site's dashboard is terrific, and may be all you need to look at for a quick overview. it displays tables and charts that show you, for example, how you're doing with spending and income and your most recent transactions. between this home page and its links, you can view your account balances and their corresponding registers; work with and add transactions; see how you're meeting your budget goals; and watch your investment portfolio prices in real time. though it doesn't include every feature in quicken's desktop version, the web version gives you the numbers you'd most want to see when you check in.  quicken excels if you're considering a personal finance application for the first time, we'd suggest you start with mint, our five-star editors' choice for free personal finance services, as it doesn't require a financial commitment. that said, mint is a web-based affair, and many people prefer a dedicated desktop app. that's where the 2019 edition of quicken deluxe shines. you'll pay an annual fee, but quicken deluxe includes excellent reports, transaction tracking, and good support. toss in the new, optional web-based interface, and quicken is a pcmag editors' choice.   quicken deluxe   excellent

our choices have constricted a bit: the smartphone os marketplace is basically down to apple's ios and google's android, and it's hard to find a really good simple voice phone nowadays. here at pcmag, we review almost every smartphone released on at&t, sprint, t-mobile, verizon wireless, and many of their sub-brands such as boost, cricket, and metropcs. rather than purely choosing the phones with the highest ratings here, we're trying to deliver a list of phones that's spread broadly across different price points. that means including two of last year's phones, the lg g6 and the iphone 8 plus, as lower-cost alternatives to this year's models. we think that provides a broader spectrum of buying options. but what should you be looking for when buying a cell phone? here are some key points to consider: which cell phone carrier should you choose? despite all the recent hardware and mobile software innovation, your wireless service provider remains your most important decision. no matter what device you buy, it's a doorstop unless you have solid wireless coverage. maybe you have friends and family on the same carrier that you talk to for free, and you don't want that to change with your next phone. maybe you're lusting after a certain device\u2014say, an unlocked smartphone for international travel. and of course, you want to choose a carrier that offers fair prices, and provides the best coverage in your area. these are all good reasons to put the carrier decision first. we have two major features to help you choose a carrier. for our readers' choice awards, pcmag readers tell us which carriers they prefer based on coverage, call quality, device selection, and other factors. and for our fastest mobile networks feature, we send drivers to 30 us cities to scope out which smartphone carriers have the best data coverage. because each of the national carriers sells a wide variety of phones, choosing your service provider should be your first move. here's a quick rundown of what each one offers: at&t's strongest areas of the country are the midwest, southeast, texas, and, this year, northern california. after a few struggling years, its speeds really jumped up in our most recent tests, and they'll get even better as the company turns on more \"5g evolution\" markets throughout the year. (5g evolution isn't 5g, but it's faster 4g than at&t previously had.) at&t owns directv, so it has some pricing bundles if you're also interested in satellite tv services.  sprint has had a rocky few years. its lte network is improving quickly, but it's still the worst-rated carrier by our readers because of several years of network troubles. that said, if you're willing to bet on a rising star, sprint has promotional service plans that can often be insanely cheap, especially if you're switching from another carrier.  see how we test cell phones t-mobile's fortunes have changed radically in the past few years thanks to maverick ceo john legere and his uncarrier plan. it's now the best rated of the \"big four\" carriers by our readers in the readers' choice awards. in our fastest mobile networks tests, it was basically neck-and-neck with verizon on speed and reliability. new low-band spectrum has radically expanded the carrier's lte network, so it can finally balance terrific speeds in cities with decent coverage in suburban areas. t-mobile also has the best international roaming plan, including to canada and mexico. verizon wireless is famed for its top-notch network quality and good customer service. its prices can be higher than the competition, but its combination of very reliable coverage and good speeds made verizon our fastest mobile networks winner this year. verizon also has the largest 4g lte network in the us. us cellular is only available in about half the country. it has a reputation for good customer service, but has been suffering recently in our surveys as readers have said its prices and lte network quality don't match up to some of the alternatives. there is also a wild slew of virtual operators that use the big four networks, but offer lower monthly rates, cheaper international calls, or other benefits. they're usually better for lighter users and most don't have family plans. the winners of our reader's choice awards this year were both virtual carriers: consumer cellular, which runs on at&t's network, and google fi, which combines sprint, t-mobile and us cellular. at&t owns cricket; sprint owns boost and virgin; t-mobile owns metropcs; and google owns google fi. tracfone is another prominent virtual carrier, with spinoff brands like straight talk, family mobile, and net10, all of which have their own plans. we spotlight some of our favorites in the best cheap cell phone plans you've never heard of. locked or unlocked? as carriers have moved to increasingly more confusing service and pricing plans, the value of unlocked phones has been rising accordingly. unlocked phones are bought from a third-party store or directly from the manufacturer, and aren't tied to any specific carrier. usually, you can use them with at&t or t-mobile. but some popular unlocked phones work on all four major carriers. if you want the best flexibility, look for a recent samsung, apple, or google pixel flagship, or a motorola phone. if you buy an unlocked phone, you'll be able to move it freely between compatible carriers. but even if you don't intend to ever change your carrier, unlocked phones are free of carrier bloatware and (with android phones) often receive software and os updates more quickly than the carrier versions do. what is the best smartphone? as more people become accustomed to instant email, web, music, and messaging access at all times of the day, regardless of where they are, smartphones have become almost indispensable. that said, there's plenty of variety out there\u2014not to mention devotees of specific os platforms. that makes sense, though; sometimes, a platform's user interface or app selection just speaks to you, and that's all there is to it. with that in mind, and at the risk of attracting flames, let's break it down as well as we can for those who aren't so fully vested.  there's actually less diversity in smartphone platforms and designs than there was a few years ago. right now, android and ios are the two top smartphone platforms, both in us sales and in the availability of third-party apps. the iphone has the best app store and the best media features. but apple's tightly controlled ecosystem can feel stifling to some, and ios isn't easy to customize or modify. there's far more variety among android handsets, and its open-source nature makes it a tweaker's dream. but it also means fragmented third-party app compatibility, occasional bugs, carrier-installed bloatware you can't remove, and scattered, often sporadic os updates. in terms of form factor, it's difficult to find a smartphone that isn't a solid black slab anymore. the only remaining, high-quality phone with a physical keyboard is the blackberry key2. it's a good device, and worth choosing if the physical keyboard is important to you, but fewer and fewer people seem to consider that a key feature with time. phones are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, to fit various sizes of hands. samsung's galaxy s9, lg's g7, and the google pixel 3 are taller and narrower than most other phones, giving them big screens that are easy to hold in one hand. the best phablets the word phablet, a portmanteau of phone and tablet, has largely gone out of style as pretty much all new phones are big phones. nowadays, it refers to the absolute biggest phones, generally with screens that are six inches diagonally or larger. these are devices that take either very large hands, or two hands, to hold. they're also devices that tend to be easy on tired or older eyes. the size of a phablet's screen doesn't necessarily reflect the size of the device. the 6.4-inch samsung galaxy note 9 is much narrower than the 6-inch zte blade z max, because it has smaller bezels and a taller, narrower screen. motorola and lg low-cost phablets tend to be good choices for people who want phones with easier-to-read, larger-to-type-on screens. the galaxy note 9 and the iphone xs max, meanwhile, are for people looking for the absolute ultimate power in their phones. the best feature phones a good portion of the us population is still using simpler phones, but there are surprisingly few current choices out there. there are still reasons to get a simple, less-expensive device: they're easier to use, and they charge much lower monthly fees because data isn't involved. there are some killer deals for voice-only usage on virtual carriers like tracfone and consumer cellular. we have one voice phone on this list, the kyocera cadence lte for verizon. the nokia 3310 3g is also unlocked, inexpensive, and works well with at&t-based carriers.  unlike smartphones, feature phones are a matter of \"what you see is what you get.\" they don't receive software upgrades or run thousands of additional apps (some feature phones come with app stores, but don't be fooled, they exist primarily to sell you additional-cost services, ringtones, wallpapers, and basic games). for voice quality, read our individual phone reviews. wireless network coverage is always the biggest factor, but individual phones can vary in reception, earpiece quality, transmission quality through the microphone, and side-tone (the echo of your own voice that helps prevent you from yelling at the other person). a phone with middling to poor reception quality can be almost impossible to use in a marginal coverage area, while one with excellent reception can make the best of the little signal that's available. another point to consider: some phones have much louder speakerphones than others. for more, see our picks for the best simple phones. we also have a roundup of the best phones for kids. the best budget phones this story tends to be headlined by very expensive phones, but you can get a perfectly good smartphone for between $100 and $250 upfront. we're big fans of motorola's low-end and midrange phones. they're unlocked and compatible with all us carriers, and they use a fast, clean version of the android os. the moto e series is available from carriers for under $100, and the moto g6 play is on amazon for $189; they're great deals. because of the current trade war between the us and china, the low-cost market has been hollowed out a bit recently. we used to recommend several phones from honor, huawei, and zte, but their future in the us is still in doubt. for the moment, look primarily at lower-end motorola and lg phones if you're trying to save money. the least expensive iphone we currently recommend is the $449 iphone 7. apple tends to program its operating systems so that once a model is about three years old, it can no longer handle some of the latest features. that means iphone models older than the 7 are getting to the end of their fully supported lives. don't buy an older iphone model.  cell phone plan pricing cell phone pricing is more confusing than ever. some carriers still have the old-school, binding two-year contracts where you pay a higher monthly rate in exchange for a discounted phone. but there also now payment plans where you pay the full retail cost of your phone, but pay less on your service plan; fast-upgrade and leasing plans where you pay a monthly fee and trade in your phone for a new one every year; as well as more carriers just selling phones for their retail price upfront. which one you choose depends on how long you intend to keep your phone and what you want to do with it after you're done with it. if you intend to upgrade frequently, you'll get the most financial advantage by buying phones upfront and reselling them on ebay when you're done with them, but that takes effort. traditional two-year deals make sense if you stick with the plan of getting a new phone every two years and you're ok with the long-term commitment. t-mobile and verizon don't offer two-year contracts anymore; you either pay upfront, or pay in installments over 24 months. apple offers leasing and installment plans just like the carriers do. there are also your monthly carrier fees. and this is where things gets tricky, as the carriers make it exceedingly difficult to figure out how much you'll actually pay per month. t-mobile now includes fees in its base advertised plan prices, and we hope other carriers will follow. at&t and verizon plans tend to cost the most, but those two carriers have the best voice and data coverage in the nation. sprint and t-mobile offer considerable savings, especially on unlimited voice, data, and texting plans. to see our most recent reviews, check out our cell phones product guide.
