for most of us, mobile phones are at the center of our universe. the typical feature set of these palm-size marvels is astounding. it's your phone, your messaging device, your web browser, your camera, your music player, your gps, and more. we're a smartphone-dominated nation, with 4g lte networks beating many home internet connections in terms of speed (not to mention 5g on the very near horizon). we have more good wireless carrier options than we've had in years, thanks to vigorous competition between the four major carriers and smaller virtual carriers like google fi. but some of our choices have constricted a bit: the smartphone os marketplace is basically down to apple's ios and google's android, and it's hard to find a really good simple voice phone nowadays. here at pcmag, we review almost every smartphone released on at&t, sprint, t-mobile, verizon wireless, and many of their sub-brands such as boost, cricket, and metropcs. rather than purely choosing the phones with the highest ratings here, we're trying to deliver a list of phones that's spread broadly across different price points. that means including two of last year's phones, the lg g6 and the iphone 8 plus, as lower-cost alternatives to this year's models. we think that provides a broader spectrum of buying options. but what should you be looking for when buying a cell phone? here are some key points to consider: which cell phone carrier should you choose? despite all the recent hardware and mobile software innovation, your wireless service provider remains your most important decision. no matter what device you buy, it's a doorstop unless you have solid wireless coverage. maybe you have friends and family on the same carrier that you talk to for free, and you don't want that to change with your next phone. maybe you're lusting after a certain device\u2014say, an unlocked smartphone for international travel. and of course, you want to choose a carrier that offers fair prices, and provides the best coverage in your area. these are all good reasons to put the carrier decision first. we have two major features to help you choose a carrier. for our readers' choice awards, pcmag readers tell us which carriers they prefer based on coverage, call quality, device selection, and other factors. and for our fastest mobile networks feature, we send drivers to 30 us cities to scope out which smartphone carriers have the best data coverage. because each of the national carriers sells a wide variety of phones, choosing your service provider should be your first move. here's a quick rundown of what each one offers: at&t's strongest areas of the country are the midwest, southeast, texas, and, this year, northern california. after a few struggling years, its speeds really jumped up in our most recent tests, and they'll get even better as the company turns on more \"5g evolution\" markets throughout the year. (5g evolution isn't 5g, but it's faster 4g than at&t previously had.) at&t owns directv, so it has some pricing bundles if you're also interested in satellite tv services.  sprint has had a rocky few years. its lte network is improving quickly, but it's still the worst-rated carrier by our readers because of several years of network troubles. that said, if you're willing to bet on a rising star, sprint has promotional service plans that can often be insanely cheap, especially if you're switching from another carrier.  see how we test cell phones t-mobile's fortunes have changed radically in the past few years thanks to maverick ceo john legere and his uncarrier plan. it's now the best rated of the \"big four\" carriers by our readers in the readers' choice awards. in our fastest mobile networks tests, it was basically neck-and-neck with verizon on speed and reliability. new low-band spectrum has radically expanded the carrier's lte network, so it can finally balance terrific speeds in cities with decent coverage in suburban areas. t-mobile also has the best international roaming plan, including to canada and mexico. verizon wireless is famed for its top-notch network quality and good customer service. its prices can be higher than the competition, but its combination of very reliable coverage and good speeds made verizon our fastest mobile networks winner this year. verizon also has the largest 4g lte network in the us. us cellular is only available in about half the country. it has a reputation for good customer service, but has been suffering recently in our surveys as readers have said its prices and lte network quality don't match up to some of the alternatives. there is also a wild slew of virtual operators that use the big four networks, but offer lower monthly rates, cheaper international calls, or other benefits. they're usually better for lighter users and most don't have family plans. the winners of our reader's choice awards this year were both virtual carriers: consumer cellular, which runs on at&t's network, and google fi, which combines sprint, t-mobile and us cellular. at&t owns cricket; sprint owns boost and virgin; t-mobile owns metropcs; and google owns google fi. tracfone is another prominent virtual carrier, with spinoff brands like straight talk, family mobile, and net10, all of which have their own plans. we spotlight some of our favorites in the best cheap cell phone plans you've never heard of. locked or unlocked? as carriers have moved to increasingly more confusing service and pricing plans, the value of unlocked phones has been rising accordingly. unlocked phones are bought from a third-party store or directly from the manufacturer, and aren't tied to any specific carrier. usually, you can use them with at&t or t-mobile. but some popular unlocked phones work on all four major carriers. if you want the best flexibility, look for a recent samsung, apple, or google pixel flagship, or a motorola phone. if you buy an unlocked phone, you'll be able to move it freely between compatible carriers. but even if you don't intend to ever change your carrier, unlocked phones are free of carrier bloatware and (with android phones) often receive software and os updates more quickly than the carrier versions do. what is the best smartphone? as more people become accustomed to instant email, web, music, and messaging access at all times of the day, regardless of where they are, smartphones have become almost indispensable. that said, there's plenty of variety out there\u2014not to mention devotees of specific os platforms. that makes sense, though; sometimes, a platform's user interface or app selection just speaks to you, and that's all there is to it. with that in mind, and at the risk of attracting flames, let's break it down as well as we can for those who aren't so fully vested.  there's actually less diversity in smartphone platforms and designs than there was a few years ago. right now, android and ios are the two top smartphone platforms, both in us sales and in the availability of third-party apps. the iphone has the best app store and the best media features. but apple's tightly controlled ecosystem can feel stifling to some, and ios isn't easy to customize or modify. there's far more variety among android handsets, and its open-source nature makes it a tweaker's dream. but it also means fragmented third-party app compatibility, occasional bugs, carrier-installed bloatware you can't remove, and scattered, often sporadic os updates. in terms of form factor, it's difficult to find a smartphone that isn't a solid black slab anymore. the only remaining, high-quality phone with a physical keyboard is the blackberry key2. it's a good device, and worth choosing if the physical keyboard is important to you, but fewer and fewer people seem to consider that a key feature with time. phones are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, to fit various sizes of hands. samsung's galaxy s9, lg's g7, and the google pixel 3 are taller and narrower than most other phones, giving them big screens that are easy to hold in one hand. the best phablets the word phablet, a portmanteau of phone and tablet, has largely gone out of style as pretty much all new phones are big phones. nowadays, it refers to the absolute biggest phones, generally with screens that are six inches diagonally or larger. these are devices that take either very large hands, or two hands, to hold. they're also devices that tend to be easy on tired or older eyes. the size of a phablet's screen doesn't necessarily reflect the size of the device. the 6.4-inch samsung galaxy note 9 is much narrower than the 6-inch zte blade z max, because it has smaller bezels and a taller, narrower screen. motorola and lg low-cost phablets tend to be good choices for people who want phones with easier-to-read, larger-to-type-on screens. the galaxy note 9 and the iphone xs max, meanwhile, are for people looking for the absolute ultimate power in their phones. the best feature phones a good portion of the us population is still using simpler phones, but there are surprisingly few current choices out there. there are still reasons to get a simple, less-expensive device: they're easier to use, and they charge much lower monthly fees because data isn't involved. there are some killer deals for voice-only usage on virtual carriers like tracfone and consumer cellular. we have one voice phone on this list, the kyocera cadence lte for verizon. the nokia 3310 3g is also unlocked, inexpensive, and works well with at&t-based carriers.  unlike smartphones, feature phones are a matter of \"what you see is what you get.\" they don't receive software upgrades or run thousands of additional apps (some feature phones come with app stores, but don't be fooled, they exist primarily to sell you additional-cost services, ringtones, wallpapers, and basic games). for voice quality, read our individual phone reviews. wireless network coverage is always the biggest factor, but individual phones can vary in reception, earpiece quality, transmission quality through the microphone, and side-tone (the echo of your own voice that helps prevent you from yelling at the other person). a phone with middling to poor reception quality can be almost impossible to use in a marginal coverage area, while one with excellent reception can make the best of the little signal that's available. another point to consider: some phones have much louder speakerphones than others. for more, see our picks for the best simple phones. we also have a roundup of the best phones for kids. the best budget phones this story tends to be headlined by very expensive phones, but you can get a perfectly good smartphone for between $100 and $250 upfront. we're big fans of motorola's low-end and midrange phones. they're unlocked and compatible with all us carriers, and they use a fast, clean version of the android os. the moto e series is available from carriers for under $100, and the moto g6 play is on amazon for $189; they're great deals. because of the current trade war between the us and china, the low-cost market has been hollowed out a bit recently. we used to recommend several phones from honor, huawei, and zte, but their future in the us is still in doubt. for the moment, look primarily at lower-end motorola and lg phones if you're trying to save money. the least expensive iphone we currently recommend is the $449 iphone 7. apple tends to program its operating systems so that once a model is about three years old, it can no longer handle some of the latest features. that means iphone models older than the 7 are getting to the end of their fully supported lives. don't buy an older iphone model.  cell phone plan pricing cell phone pricing is more confusing than ever. some carriers still have the old-school, binding two-year contracts where you pay a higher monthly rate in exchange for a discounted phone. but there also now payment plans where you pay the full retail cost of your phone, but pay less on your service plan; fast-upgrade and leasing plans where you pay a monthly fee and trade in your phone for a new one every year; as well as more carriers just selling phones for their retail price upfront. which one you choose depends on how long you intend to keep your phone and what you want to do with it after you're done with it. if you intend to upgrade frequently, you'll get the most financial advantage by buying phones upfront and reselling them on ebay when you're done with them, but that takes effort. traditional two-year deals make sense if you stick with the plan of getting a new phone every two years and you're ok with the long-term commitment. t-mobile and verizon don't offer two-year contracts anymore; you either pay upfront, or pay in installments over 24 months. apple offers leasing and installment plans just like the carriers do. there are also your monthly carrier fees. and this is where things gets tricky, as the carriers make it exceedingly difficult to figure out how much you'll actually pay per month. t-mobile now includes fees in its base advertised plan prices, and we hope other carriers will follow. at&t and verizon plans tend to cost the most, but those two carriers have the best voice and data coverage in the nation. sprint and t-mobile offer considerable savings, especially on unlimited voice, data, and texting plans. to see our most recent reviews, check out our cell phones product guide.

why you need a faster phone       in our last fastest mobile networks survey of the 4g era, verizon once again cements its position as the 4g leader. the nation's largest carrier also runs the nation's fastest lte data network, with the fastest download speeds and lowest latency. we've been drive testing american mobile networks since 2010, first 3g and then 4g, watching speeds grow and coverage expand. yes, there are still dead zones out there\u2014american cities have less reliable mobile coverage than canadian cities, we've found. but we've seen steady improvement over the years, especially from t-mobile, and americans in major metropolitan areas can now generally assume a level of service they couldn't a few years ago. faster speeds than ever compared with 2017, we're seeing faster, more consistent lte connections on all four major us wireless networks. peak speeds have jumped from the 200mbps range to the 300mbps range, average download speeds have bumped up by 10mbps or more, and latency has dropped by 10ms. that's an impressive change in one year, and it continues the trend of improvement that we've seen over the past several years of testing. see how speeds have changed over the past few years on our national results page.  much more than previous years, we saw many cities where the carrier with the fastest average download speeds didn't win the award. we're ok with that. our speed score tries to balance all of the components of a mobile connection: downloads, uploads, availability, and latency. (for more details, see our testing methodology page.) as we get to a world where we can assume 20mbps or higher download speeds on 4g in most cities, other questions arise: where are those speeds most consistent? where is the network most responsive, especially when you're downloading pages made of many small files? our tests cover data speeds and reliability; we don't make voice calls. but our awards for data service apply more and more to voice, too. all of the carriers other than sprint now use voice-over-lte, piping their voice calls through their data networks. so the reliability of those lte data networks translates into the reliability of your hd voice calls, as well.  get ready for 5g next year, we're going to have a new challenge: 5g is coming. while all of the carriers have built somewhat similar 4g networks (well, except for sprint's extreme focus on downloads over uploads), they're taking radically different approaches for 5g. at&t and verizon are going for much higher speeds over smaller areas; t-mobile is looking to blanket the nation, but at slower speeds. while they're all going to call their new networks 5g, it'll be like they're coming from different worlds. for more, see 4g and 5g: what's next? what does this mean for choosing your wireless carrier? we've seen broad, multi-year trends developing recently. verizon and t-mobile are the clear network leaders for smartphone users, with t-mobile's strength coming in uploads, for the social-media, content-creator crowd. at&t and sprint have focused on download speeds, so they are best for content consumption, video streaming, and web browsing. if you're dissatisfied with your speeds and coverage, consider switching your phone before you switch your carrier. all four major carriers have been laying down new technologies recently that old phones just don't support. our story on why you need a new phone explains this further. national results make great headlines, but we think our city-by-city results will be more relevant to you. verizon won or tied in 20 cities/areas, but other carriers\u2014especially t-mobile\u2014won plenty of awards as well. we stopped by more than a dozen locations in each of 30 us cities, as well as collecting data on the drives between them, to build our city results. click through this story, or use the navigation above, to see the results in

for most of us, mobile phones are at the center of our universe. the typical feature set of these palm-size marvels is astounding. it's your phone, your messaging device, your web browser, your camera, your music player, your gps, and more. we're a smartphone-dominated nation, with 4g lte networks beating many home internet connections in terms of speed (not to mention 5g on the very near horizon). we have more good wireless carrier options than we've had in years, thanks to vigorous competition between the four major carriers and smaller virtual carriers like google fi. but some of our choices have constricted a bit: the smartphone os marketplace is basically down to apple's ios and google's android, and it's hard to find a really good simple voice phone nowadays. here at pcmag, we review almost every smartphone released on at&t, sprint, t-mobile, verizon wireless, and many of their sub-brands such as boost, cricket, and metropcs. rather than purely choosing the phones with the highest ratings here, we're trying to deliver a list of phones that's spread broadly across different price points. that means including two of last year's phones, the lg g6 and the iphone 8 plus, as lower-cost alternatives to this year's models. we think that provides a broader spectrum of buying options. but what should you be looking for when buying a cell phone? here are some key points to consider: which cell phone carrier should you choose? despite all the recent hardware and mobile software innovation, your wireless service provider remains your most important decision. no matter what device you buy, it's a doorstop unless you have solid wireless coverage. maybe you have friends and family on the same carrier that you talk to for free, and you don't want that to change with your next phone. maybe you're lusting after a certain device\u2014say, an unlocked smartphone for international travel. and of course, you want to choose a carrier that offers fair prices, and provides the best coverage in your area. these are all good reasons to put the carrier decision first. we have two major features to help you choose a carrier. for our readers' choice awards, pcmag readers tell us which carriers they prefer based on coverage, call quality, device selection, and other factors. and for our fastest mobile networks feature, we send drivers to 30 us cities to scope out which smartphone carriers have the best data coverage. because each of the national carriers sells a wide variety of phones, choosing your service provider should be your first move. here's a quick rundown of what each one offers: at&t's strongest areas of the country are the midwest, southeast, texas, and, this year, northern california. after a few struggling years, its speeds really jumped up in our most recent tests, and they'll get even better as the company turns on more \"5g evolution\" markets throughout the year. (5g evolution isn't 5g, but it's faster 4g than at&t previously had.) at&t owns directv, so it has some pricing bundles if you're also interested in satellite tv services.  sprint has had a rocky few years. its lte network is improving quickly, but it's still the worst-rated carrier by our readers because of several years of network troubles. that said, if you're willing to bet on a rising star, sprint has promotional service plans that can often be insanely cheap, especially if you're switching from another carrier.  see how we test cell phones t-mobile's fortunes have changed radically in the past few years thanks to maverick ceo john legere and his uncarrier plan. it's now the best rated of the \"big four\" carriers by our readers in the readers' choice awards. in our fastest mobile networks tests, it was basically neck-and-neck with verizon on speed and reliability. new low-band spectrum has radically expanded the carrier's lte network, so it can finally balance terrific speeds in cities with decent coverage in suburban areas. t-mobile also has the best international roaming plan, including to canada and mexico. verizon wireless is famed for its top-notch network quality and good customer service. its prices can be higher than the competition, but its combination of very reliable coverage and good speeds made verizon our fastest mobile networks winner this year. verizon also has the largest 4g lte network in the us. us cellular is only available in about half the country. it has a reputation for good customer service, but has been suffering recently in our surveys as readers have said its prices and lte network quality don't match up to some of the alternatives. there is also a wild slew of virtual operators that use the big four networks, but offer lower monthly rates, cheaper international calls, or other benefits. they're usually better for lighter users and most don't have family plans. the winners of our reader's choice awards this year were both virtual carriers: consumer cellular, which runs on at&t's network, and google fi, which combines sprint, t-mobile and us cellular. at&t owns cricket; sprint owns boost and virgin; t-mobile owns metropcs; and google owns google fi. tracfone is another prominent virtual carrier, with spinoff brands like straight talk, family mobile, and net10, all of which have their own plans. we spotlight some of our favorites in the best cheap cell phone plans you've never heard of. locked or unlocked? as carriers have moved to increasingly more confusing service and pricing plans, the value of unlocked phones has been rising accordingly. unlocked phones are bought from a third-party store or directly from the manufacturer, and aren't tied to any specific carrier. usually, you can use them with at&t or t-mobile. but some popular unlocked phones work on all four major carriers. if you want the best flexibility, look for a recent samsung, apple, or google pixel flagship, or a motorola phone. if you buy an unlocked phone, you'll be able to move it freely between compatible carriers. but even if you don't intend to ever change your carrier, unlocked phones are free of carrier bloatware and (with android phones) often receive software and os updates more quickly than the carrier versions do. what is the best smartphone? as more people become accustomed to instant email, web, music, and messaging access at all times of the day, regardless of where they are, smartphones have become almost indispensable. that said, there's plenty of variety out there\u2014not to mention devotees of specific os platforms. that makes sense, though; sometimes, a platform's user interface or app selection just speaks to you, and that's all there is to it. with that in mind, and at the risk of attracting flames, let's break it down as well as we can for those who aren't so fully vested.  there's actually less diversity in smartphone platforms and designs than there was a few years ago. right now, android and ios are the two top smartphone platforms, both in us sales and in the availability of third-party apps. the iphone has the best app store and the best media features. but apple's tightly controlled ecosystem can feel stifling to some, and ios isn't easy to customize or modify. there's far more variety among android handsets, and its open-source nature makes it a tweaker's dream. but it also means fragmented third-party app compatibility, occasional bugs, carrier-installed bloatware you can't remove, and scattered, often sporadic os updates. in terms of form factor, it's difficult to find a smartphone that isn't a solid black slab anymore. the only remaining, high-quality phone with a physical keyboard is the blackberry key2. it's a good device, and worth choosing if the physical keyboard is important to you, but fewer and fewer people seem to consider that a key feature with time. phones are available in a wide range of sizes and shapes, to fit various sizes of hands. samsung's galaxy s9, lg's g7, and the google pixel 3 are taller and narrower than most other phones, giving them big screens that are easy to hold in one hand. the best phablets the word phablet, a portmanteau of phone and tablet, has largely gone out of style as pretty much all new phones are big phones. nowadays, it refers to the absolute biggest phones, generally with screens that are six inches diagonally or larger. these are devices that take either very large hands, or two hands, to hold. they're also devices that tend to be easy on tired or older eyes. the size of a phablet's screen doesn't necessarily reflect the size of the device. the 6.4-inch samsung galaxy note 9 is much narrower than the 6-inch zte blade z max, because it has smaller bezels and a taller, narrower screen. motorola and lg low-cost phablets tend to be good choices for people who want phones with easier-to-read, larger-to-type-on screens. the galaxy note 9 and the iphone xs max, meanwhile, are for people looking for the absolute ultimate power in their phones. the best feature phones a good portion of the us population is still using simpler phones, but there are surprisingly few current choices out there. there are still reasons to get a simple, less-expensive device: they're easier to use, and they charge much lower monthly fees because data isn't involved. there are some killer deals for voice-only usage on virtual carriers like tracfone and consumer cellular. we have one voice phone on this list, the kyocera cadence lte for verizon. the nokia 3310 3g is also unlocked, inexpensive, and works well with at&t-based carriers.  unlike smartphones, feature phones are a matter of \"what you see is what you get.\" they don't receive software upgrades or run thousands of additional apps (some feature phones come with app stores, but don't be fooled, they exist primarily to sell you additional-cost services, ringtones, wallpapers, and basic games). for voice quality, read our individual phone reviews. wireless network coverage is always the biggest factor, but individual phones can vary in reception, earpiece quality, transmission quality through the microphone, and side-tone (the echo of your own voice that helps prevent you from yelling at the other person). a phone with middling to poor reception quality can be almost impossible to use in a marginal coverage area, while one with excellent reception can make the best of the little signal that's available. another point to consider: some phones have much louder speakerphones than others. for more, see our picks for the best simple phones. we also have a roundup of the best phones for kids. the best budget phones this story tends to be headlined by very expensive phones, but you can get a perfectly good smartphone for between $100 and $250 upfront. we're big fans of motorola's low-end and midrange phones. they're unlocked and compatible with all us carriers, and they use a fast, clean version of the android os. the moto e series is available from carriers for under $100, and the moto g6 play is on amazon for $189; they're great deals. because of the current trade war between the us and china, the low-cost market has been hollowed out a bit recently. we used to recommend several phones from honor, huawei, and zte, but their future in the us is still in doubt. for the moment, look primarily at lower-end motorola and lg phones if you're trying to save money. the least expensive iphone we currently recommend is the $449 iphone 7. apple tends to program its operating systems so that once a model is about three years old, it can no longer handle some of the latest features. that means iphone models older than the 7 are getting to the end of their fully supported lives. don't buy an older iphone model.  cell phone plan pricing cell phone pricing is more confusing than ever. some carriers still have the old-school, binding two-year contracts where you pay a higher monthly rate in exchange for a discounted phone. but there also now payment plans where you pay the full retail cost of your phone, but pay less on your service plan; fast-upgrade and leasing plans where you pay a monthly fee and trade in your phone for a new one every year; as well as more carriers just selling phones for their retail price upfront. which one you choose depends on how long you intend to keep your phone and what you want to do with it after you're done with it. if you intend to upgrade frequently, you'll get the most financial advantage by buying phones upfront and reselling them on ebay when you're done with them, but that takes effort. traditional two-year deals make sense if you stick with the plan of getting a new phone every two years and you're ok with the long-term commitment. t-mobile and verizon don't offer two-year contracts anymore; you either pay upfront, or pay in installments over 24 months. apple offers leasing and installment plans just like the carriers do. there are also your monthly carrier fees. and this is where things gets tricky, as the carriers make it exceedingly difficult to figure out how much you'll actually pay per month. t-mobile now includes fees in its base advertised plan prices, and we hope other carriers will follow. at&t and verizon plans tend to cost the most, but those two carriers have the best voice and data coverage in the nation. sprint and t-mobile offer considerable savings, especially on unlimited voice, data, and texting plans. to see our most recent reviews, check out our cell phones product guide.
